Pakistan will also not allow Iran's envoy in Islamabad, who is visiting his home country, to return, the ministry's spokesperson said in a statement. </p><p> She said the violation was an unprovoked and blatant breach of Pakistan's sovereignty and was \"unacceptable\". </p><p> \"Pakistan reserves the right to respond to this illegal act,\" she said. </p><p> Pakistan said the incident resulted in the death of two children. </p><p> Iranian news agency Mehrnews said the \"missile and drone\" attack targeted the Jaish al-Adl group's headquarters in Pakistan, calling it \"another decisive step taken by Iran in response to the aggression against the security of our country\". </p><p> The raid came late on Tuesday after <a href=\"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/iraq-recalls-iran-envoy-rebuke-ally-over-deadly-strikes-4051031\"> Tehran also launched attacks in Iraq </a> and Syria against what it called \"anti-Iranian terrorist groups\". </p><p> Pakistan denounced the strike, near the nations' shared border. </p><p> \"Last night's unprovoked and blatant breach of Pakistan's sovereignty by Iran is a violation of international law and the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,\" spokeswoman Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said in a statement on Wednesday. </p><h2> JAISH AL-ADL IS BLACKLISTED BY IRAN </h2><p> Tehran's top diplomat insisted his country's armed forces had targeted \"Iranian terrorist group\" Jaish al-Adl in Pakistan. </p><p> \"None of the nationals of the friendly and brotherly country of Pakistan were targeted by Iranian missiles and drones,\" Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. </p><p> Formed in 2012, Jaish al-Adl is blacklisted by Iran as a terrorist group and has carried out several attacks on Iranian soil in recent years. </p><p> The Iranian foreign ministry said Amir-Abdollahian spoke with his Pakistani counterpart Jalil Abbas Jilani on Wednesday, stressing that \"Pakistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity are of great concern\". </p><p>

It can converse cogently about mineral extraction in Papua New Guinea, or about  TSMC  , a Taiwanese semiconductor firm that finds itself in the geopolitical crosshairs.  GPT  -4, the artificial neural network which powers Chat  GPT  , has aced exams that serve as gateways for people to enter careers in law and medicine in America. It can generate songs, poems and essays. Other \"generative  AI  \" models can churn out digital photos, drawings and animations.\n\nRunning alongside this excitement is  deep concern  , inside the tech industry and beyond, that generative  AI  models are being developed too quickly.  GPT  -4 is a type of generative  AI  called a large language model (  LLM  ). Tech giants like Alphabet, Amazon and Nvidia have all trained their own  LLM  s, and given them names like  P  a  LM  , Megatron, Titan and Chinchilla.\n\nTHE LURE GROWS GREATER\nThe London tech boss says he is \"incredibly nervous about the existential threat\" posed by  AI  , even as he pursues it, and is \"speaking with [other] founders about it daily\". Governments in America, Europe and China have all started mulling new regulations. Prominent voices are calling for the development of artificial intelligence to be paused, lest the software somehow run out of control and damage, or even destroy, human society. To calibrate how worried or excited you should be about this technology, it helps first to understand where it came from, how it works and what the limits are to its growth.\n\nThe contemporary explosion of the capabilities of  AI  software began in the early 2010s, when a software technique called \"deep learning\" became popular. Using the magic mix of vast datasets and powerful computers running neural networks on Graphics Processing Units (  GPU  s), deep learning dramatically improved computers' abilities to recognise images, process audio and play games. By the late 2010s computers could do many of these tasks better than any human.\n\nBut neural networks tended to be embedded in software with broader functionality, like email clients, and non-coders rarely interacted with these  AI  s directly. Those that did often described their experience in near-spiritual terms. Lee Sedol, one of the world's best players of Go, an ancient Chinese board game, retired from the game after Alphabet's neural-net-based AlphaGo software crushed him in 2016. \"Even if I become the number one,\" he said, \"there is an entity that cannot be defeated.\"\n\nBy working in the most human of mediums, conversation, Chat  GPT  is now allowing the internet-using public to experience something similar, a kind of intellectual vertigo caused by software which has improved suddenly to the point where it can perform tasks that had been exclusively in the domain of human intelligence.\n\nDespite that feeling of magic, an  LLM  is, in reality, a giant exercise in statistics. Prompt Chat  GPT  to finish the sentence: \"The promise of large language models is that they\" and you will get an immediate response. How does it work?\n\nFirst, the language of the query is  converted from words, which neural networks cannot handle, into a representative set of numbers  (see graphic).  GPT  -3, which powered an earlier version of Chat  GPT  , does this by splitting text into chunks of characters, called tokens, which commonly occur together. These tokens can be words, like \"love\" or \"are\", affixes, like \"dis\" or \"ised\", and punctuation, like \"?\".  GPT  -3's dictionary contains details of 50,257 tokens.\n\nTokenisation\n\nThe\n\n464  promise\n\n6991  of\n\n286  large\n\n1588  language\n\n3303  models\n\n4981  is\n\n318  that\n\n326  they\n\n484\n\nGPT  -3 is able to process a maximum of 2,048 tokens at a time, which is around the length of a long article in  The  Economist  .  GPT  -4, by contrast, can handle inputs up to 32,000 tokens longa novella. The more text the model can take in, the more context it can see, and the better its answers will be. There is a catchthe required computation rises non-linearly with the length of the input, meaning slightly longer inputs need much more computing power.\n\nThe tokens are then  assigned the equivalent of definitions  by placing them into a \"meaning space\" where words that have similar meanings are located in nearby areas.\n\nEmbedding\n\nfacsimile\n\nvocabulary\n\nlanguage\n\ntongue\n\nmodel\n\nreplica\n\naptitude\n\ntalent\n\nspeech\n\nduplicate\n\nimitation\n\npotentiality\n\nability\n\nrepresentation\n\npotential\n\ncapability\n\nmassive\n\nlookalike\n\npromise\n\ncapacity\n\ngreat\n\nvast\n\nhuge\n\nenourmous\n\nbig\n\nlarge\n\nThe  LLM  then deploys its \"attention network\" to make connections between different parts of the prompt. Someone reading our prompt, \"the promise of large language models is that they\", would know how English grammar works and understand the concepts behind the words in the sentence. It would be obvious to them which words relate to each otherit is the model that is large, for example. An  LLM  , however, must learn these associations from scratch during its training phaseover billions of training runs, its  attention network slowly encodes the structure of the language it sees as numbers (called \"weights\")  within its neural network. If it understands language at all, an  LLM  only does so in a statistical, rather than a grammatical, way. It is much more like an abacus than it is like a mind.\n\nAttention\n\nThe\n\npromise\n\nof\n\nlarge\n\nlanguage\n\nmodels\n\nis\n\nthat\n\nthey\n\n22%\n\n20%\n\n18%\n\n8%\n\n12%\n\n3%\n\n9%\n\n5%\n\n2%\n\nThe\n\npromise\n\nof\n\nlarge\n\nlanguage\n\nmodels\n\nis\n\nthat\n\nthey\n\nOnce the prompt has been processed, the  LLM  initiates a response. At this point, for each of the tokens in the model's vocabulary, the attention network has produced a probability of that token being the most appropriate one to use next in the sentence it is generating. The token with the highest probability score is not always the one chosen for the responsehow the  LLM  makes this choice depends on how creative the model has been told to be by its operators.\n\nThe  LLM  generates a word  and then feeds the result back into itself. The first word is generated based on the prompt alone. The second word is generated by including the first word in the response, then the third word by including the first two generated words, and so on. This processcalled autoregressionrepeats until the  LLM  has finished.\n\nCompletion\n\nThe  promise  of  large  language  models  is  that  they  can  be  used  to  generate  text  that  is  indistinguishable  from  human\n\n-\n\nwritten  text\n\n.\n\nAlthough it is possible to write down the rules for how they work,  LLM  s' outputs are not entirely predictable; it turns out that these extremely big abacuses can do things which smaller ones cannot, in ways which surprise even the people who make them. Jason Wei, a researcher at Open  AI  , has counted 137 so-called \"emergent\" abilities across a variety of different  LLM  s.\n\nThe abilities that emerge are not magicthey are all represented in some form within the  LLM  s' training data (or the prompts they are given) but they do not become apparent until the  LLM  s cross a certain, very large, threshold in their size. At one size, an  LLM  does not know how to write gender-inclusive sentences in German any better than if it was doing so at random. Make the model just a little bigger, however, and all of a sudden a new ability pops out.  GPT  -4 passed the American Uniform Bar Examination, designed to test the skills of lawyers before they become licensed, in the 90th percentile. The slightly smaller  GPT  -3.5 flunked it.\n\nEmergent abilities are exciting, because they hint at the untapped potential of  LLM  s. Jonas Degrave, an engineer at DeepMind, an  AI  research company owned by Alphabet, has shown that Chat  GPT  can be convinced to act like the command line terminal of a computer, appearing to compile and run programs accurately. Just a little bigger, goes the thinking, and the models may suddenly be able to do all manner of useful new things. But experts worry for the same reason. One analysis shows that certain social biases emerge when models become large. It is not easy to tell what harmful behaviours might be lying dormant, waiting for just a little more scale in order to be unleashed.\n\nPROCESS THE DATA\nThe recent success of  LLM  s in generating convincing text, as well as their startling emergent abilities, is due to the coalescence of three things: gobsmacking quantities of data, algorithms capable of learning from them and the computational power to do so (see chart). The details of  GPT  -4's construction and function are not yet public, but those of  GPT  -3 are, in a paper called \"Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\", published in 2020 by Open  AI  .\n\nFaster, higher, more calculations\n\nComputing power used in training AI systems\n\nSelected systems, floating-point operations, log scale\n\nAcademia\n\nIndustry\n\nResearch consortium\n\nGPT-4\n\nGPT-3\n\nStable Diffusion\n\nTransformer\n\nTheseus\n\n1950\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n2000\n\n10\n\n23\n\nSources: Sevilla et al., 2023; Our World in Data\n\nBefore it sees any training data, the weights in  GPT  -3's neural network are mostly random. As a result, any text it generates will be gibberish. Pushing its output towards something which makes sense, and eventually something that is fluent, requires training.  GPT  -3 was trained on several sources of data, but the bulk of it comes from snapshots of the entire internet between 2016 and 2019 taken from a database called Common Crawl. There's a lot of junk text on the internet, so the initial 45 terabytes were filtered using a different machine-learning model to select just the high-quality text: 570 gigabytes of it, a dataset that could fit on a modern laptop. In addition,  GPT  -4 was trained on an unknown quantity of images, probably several terabytes. By comparison AlexNet, a neural network that reignited image-processing excitement in the 2010s, was trained on a dataset of 1.2m labelled images, a total of 126 gigabytesless than a tenth of the size of  GPT  -4's likely dataset.\n\nTo train, the  LLM  quizzes itself on the text it is given. It takes a chunk, covers up some words at the end, and tries to guess what might go there. Then the  LLM  uncovers the answer and compares it to its guess. Because the answers are in the data itself, these models can be trained in a \"self-supervised\" manner on massive datasets without requiring human labellers.\n\nThe model's goal is to make its guesses as good as possible by making as few errors as possible. Not all errors are equal, though. If the original text is \"I love ice cream\", guessing \"I love ice hockey\" is better than \"I love ice are\". How bad a guess is is turned into a number called the loss. After a few guesses, the loss is sent back into the neural network and used to nudge the weights in a direction that will produce better answers.\n\nTRAILBLAZING A DAZE\nThe  LLM  's attention network is key to learning from such vast amounts of data. It builds into the model a way to learn and use associations between words and concepts even when they appear at a distance from each other within a text, and it allows it to process reams of data in a reasonable amount of time. Many different attention networks operate in parallel within a typical  LLM  and this parallelisation allows the process to be run across multiple  GPU  s. Older, non-attention-based versions of language models would not have been able to process such a quantity of data in a reasonable amount of time. \"Without attention, the scaling would not be computationally tractable,\" says Yoshua Bengio, scientific director of Mila, a prominent AI research institute in Quebec.\n\nThe sheer scale at which  LLM  s can process data has been driving their recent growth.  GPT  -3 has hundreds of layers, billions of weights, and was trained on hundreds of billions of words. By contrast, the first version of  GPT  , created five years ago, was just one ten-thousandth of the size.\n\nBut there are good reasons, says Dr Bengio, to think that this growth cannot continue indefinitely. The inputs of  LLM  sdata, computing power, electricity, skilled labourcost money. Training  GPT  -3, for example, used 1.3 gigawatt-hours of electricity (enough to power 121 homes in America for a year), and cost Open  AI  an estimated $4.6m.  GPT  -4, which is a much larger model, will have cost disproportionately more (in the realm of $100m) to train. Since computing-power requirements scale up dramatically faster than the input data, training  LLM  s gets expensive faster than it gets better. Indeed, Sam Altman, the boss of Open  AI  , seems to think an inflection point has already arrived. On April 13th he told an audience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology: \"I think we're at the end of the era where it's going to be these, like, giant, giant models. We'll make them better in other ways.\"\n\nBut the most important limit to the continued improvement of  LLM  s is the amount of training data available.  GPT  -3 has already been trained on what amounts to all of the high-quality text that is available to download from the internet. A paper published in October 2022 concluded that \"the stock of high-quality language data will be exhausted soon; likely before 2026.\" There is certainly more text available, but it is locked away in small amounts in corporate databases or on personal devices, inaccessible at the scale and low cost that Common Crawl allows.\n\nComputers will get more powerful over time, but there is no new hardware forthcoming which offers a leap in performance as large as that which came from using  GPU  s in the early 2010s, so training larger models will probably be increasingly expensiveperhaps why Mr Altman is not enthused by the idea. Improvements are possible, including new kinds of chips such as Google's Tensor Processing Unit, but the manufacturing of chips is no longer improving exponentially through Moore's law and shrinking circuits.\n\nThere will also be legal issues. Stability  AI  , a company which produces an image-generation model called Stable Diffusion, has been sued by Getty Images, a photography agency. Stable Diffusion's training data comes from the same place as  GPT  -3 and  GPT  -4, Common Crawl, and it processes it in very similar ways, using attention networks. Some of the most striking examples of  AI  's generative prowess have been images. People on the internet are now regularly getting caught up in excitement about apparent photos of scenes that never took place: the pope in a Balenciaga jacket; Donald Trump being arrested.\n\nGetty points to images produced by Stable Diffusion which contain its copyright watermark, suggesting that Stable Diffusion has ingested and is reproducing copyrighted material without permission (Stability AI has not yet commented publicly on the lawsuit). The same level of evidence is harder to come by when examining Chat  GPT  's text output, but there is no doubt that it has been trained on copyrighted material. Open  AI  will be hoping that its text generation is covered by \"fair use\", a provision in copyright law that allows limited use of copyrighted material for \"transformative\" purposes. That idea will probably one day be tested in court.\n\nA MAJOR APPLIANCE\nBut even in a scenario where  LLM  s stopped improving this year, and a blockbuster lawsuit drove Open  AI  to bankruptcy, the power of large language models would remain. The data and the tools to process it are widely available, even if the sheer scale achieved by Open  AI  remains expensive.\n\nOpen-source implementations, when trained carefully and selectively, are already aping the performance of  GPT  -4. This is a good thing: having the power of  LLM  s in many hands means that many minds can come up with innovative new applications, improving everything from medicine to the law.",

There\u2019s a lot of junk text on the internet, so the initial 45 terabytes were filtered using a different machine-learning model to select just the high-quality text: 570 gigabytes of it, a dataset that could fit on a modern laptop. In addition, <small> GPT </small> -4 was trained on an unknown quantity of images, probably several terabytes. By comparison AlexNet, a neural network that reignited image-processing excitement in the 2010s, was trained on a dataset of 1.2m labelled images, a total of 126 gigabytes\u2014less than a tenth of the size of <small> GPT </small> -4\u2019s likely dataset. </div><div> To train, the <small> LLM </small> quizzes itself on the text it is given.

Not all errors are equal, though. If the original text is \u201cI love ice cream\u201d, guessing \u201cI love ice hockey\u201d is better than \u201cI love ice are\u201d. How bad a guess is is turned into a number called the loss. After a few guesses, the loss is sent back into the neural network and used to nudge the weights in a direction that will produce better answers. </div><h2> Trailblazing a daze </h2><div> The <small> LLM </small> \u2019s attention network is key to learning from such vast amounts of data. It builds into the model a way to learn and use associations between words and concepts even when they appear at a distance from each other within a text, and it allows it to process reams of data in a reasonable amount of time. Many different attention networks operate in parallel within a typical <small> LLM </small> and this parallelisation allows the process to be run across multiple <small> GPU </small> s. Older, non-attention-based versions of language models would not have been able to process such a quantity of data in a reasonable amount of time. \u201cWithout attention, the scaling would not be computationally tractable,\u201d says Yoshua Bengio, scientific director of Mila, a prominent AI research institute in Quebec. </div><div> The sheer scale at which <small> LLM </small> s can process data has been driving their recent growth. <small> GPT </small> -3 has hundreds of layers, billions of weights, and was trained on hundreds of billions of words. By contrast, the first version of <small> GPT </small> , created five years ago, was just one ten-thousandth of the size. </div><div> But there are good reasons, says Dr Bengio, to think that this growth cannot continue indefinitely. The inputs of <small> LLM </small> s\u2014data, computing power, electricity, skilled labour\u2014cost money. Training <small> GPT </small> -3, for example, used 1.3 gigawatt-hours of electricity (enough to power 121 homes in America for a year), and cost Open <small> AI </small> an estimated $4.6m. <small> GPT </small> -4, which is a much larger model, will have cost disproportionately more (in the realm of $100m) to train. Since computing-power requirements scale up dramatically faster than the input data, training <small> LLM </small> s gets expensive faster than it gets better. Indeed, Sam Altman, the boss of Open <small> AI </small> , seems to think an inflection point has already arrived. On April 13th he told an audience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology: \u201cI think we\u2019re at the end of the era where it\u2019s going to be these, like, giant, giant models. We\u2019ll make them better in other ways.\u201d </div><div> But the most important limit to the continued improvement of <small> LLM </small> s is the amount of training data available. <small> GPT </small> -3 has already been trained on what amounts to all of the high-quality text that is available to download from the internet. A paper published in October 2022 concluded that \u201cthe stock of high-quality language data will be exhausted soon; likely before 2026.\u201d There is certainly more text available, but it is locked away in small amounts in corporate databases or on personal devices, inaccessible at the scale and low cost that Common Crawl allows. </div><div> Computers will get more powerful over time, but there is no new hardware forthcoming which offers a leap in performance as large as that which came from using <small> GPU </small> s in the early 2010s, so training larger models will probably be increasingly expensive\u2014perhaps why Mr Altman is not enthused by the idea. Improvements are possible, including new kinds of chips such as Google\u2019s Tensor Processing Unit, but the manufacturing of chips is no longer improving exponentially through Moore\u2019s law and shrinking circuits. </div><div> There will also be legal issues. Stability <small> AI </small> , a company which produces an image-generation model called Stable Diffusion, has been sued by Getty Images, a photography agency. Stable Diffusion\u2019s training data comes from the same place as <small> GPT </small> -3 and <small> GPT </small> -4, Common Crawl, and it processes it in very similar ways, using attention networks. Some of the most striking examples of <small> AI </small> \u2019s generative prowess have been images. People on the internet are now regularly getting caught up in excitement about apparent photos of scenes that never took place: the pope in a Balenciaga jacket; Donald Trump being arrested. </div><div> Getty points to images produced by Stable Diffusion which contain its copyright watermark, suggesting that Stable Diffusion has ingested and is reproducing copyrighted material without permission (Stability AI has not yet commented publicly on the lawsuit). The same level of evidence is harder to come by when examining Chat <small> GPT </small> \u2019s text output, but there is no doubt that it has been trained on copyrighted material. Open <small> AI </small> will be hoping that its text generation is covered by \u201cfair use\u201d, a provision in copyright law that allows limited use of copyrighted material for \u201ctransformative\u201d purposes. That idea will probably one day be tested in court. </div><h2> A major appliance </h2><div> But even in a scenario where <small> LLM </small> s stopped improving this year, and a blockbuster lawsuit drove Open <small> AI </small> to bankruptcy, the power of large language models would remain. The data and the tools to process it are widely available, even if the sheer scale achieved by Open <small> AI </small> remains expensive. </div><div> Open-source implementations, when trained carefully and selectively, are already aping the performance of <small> GPT </small> -4. This is a good thing: having the power of <small> LLM </small> s in many hands means that many minds can come up with innovative new applications, improving everything from medicine to the law. </div></div>",

IN THE FIRST OF THREE SPECIAL ARTICLES WE EXPLAIN HOW THEY WORK\n\nS  ince November  2022, when Open  AI  , the company which makes Chat  GPT  , first opened the chatbot to the public, there has been little else that the tech elite has wanted to talk about. As this article was being written, the founder of a London technology company messaged your correspondent unprompted to say that this kind of  AI  is \u201cessentially all I\u2019m thinking about these days\u201d. He says he is in the process of redesigning his company, valued at many hundreds of millions of dollars, around it. He is not alone.\n\nChat  GPT  embodies  more knowledge  than any human has ever known. It can converse cogently about mineral extraction in Papua New Guinea, or about  TSMC  , a Taiwanese semiconductor firm that finds itself in the geopolitical crosshairs.  GPT  -4, the artificial neural network which powers Chat  GPT  , has aced exams that serve as gateways for people to enter careers in law and medicine in America. It can generate songs, poems and essays. Other \u201cgenerative  AI  \u201d models can churn out digital photos, drawings and animations.\n\nRunning alongside this excitement is  deep concern  , inside the tech industry and beyond, that generative  AI  models are being developed too quickly.  GPT  -4 is a type of generative  AI  called a large language model (  LLM  ). Tech giants like Alphabet, Amazon and Nvidia have all trained their own  LLM  s, and given them names like  P  a  LM  , Megatron, Titan and Chinchilla.\n\nTHE LURE GROWS GREATER\nThe London tech boss says he is \u201cincredibly nervous about the existential threat\u201d posed by  AI  , even as he pursues it, and is \u201cspeaking with [other] founders about it daily\u201d. Governments in America, Europe and China have all started mulling new regulations. Prominent voices are calling for the development of artificial intelligence to be paused, lest the software somehow run out of control and damage, or even destroy, human society. To calibrate how worried or excited you should be about this technology, it helps first to understand where it came from, how it works and what the limits are to its growth.\n\nThe contemporary explosion of the capabilities of  AI  software began in the early 2010s, when a software technique called \u201cdeep learning\u201d became popular. Using the magic mix of vast datasets and powerful computers running neural networks on Graphics Processing Units (  GPU  s), deep learning dramatically improved computers\u2019 abilities to recognise images, process audio and play games. By the late 2010s computers could do many of these tasks better than any human.\n\nBut neural networks tended to be embedded in software with broader functionality, like email clients, and non-coders rarely interacted with these  AI  s directly. Those that did often described their experience in near-spiritual terms. Lee Sedol, one of the world\u2019s best players of Go, an ancient Chinese board game, retired from the game after Alphabet\u2019s neural-net-based AlphaGo software crushed him in 2016. \u201cEven if I become the number one,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is an entity that cannot be defeated.\u201d\n\nBy working in the most human of mediums, conversation, Chat  GPT  is now allowing the internet-using public to experience something similar, a kind of intellectual vertigo caused by software which has improved suddenly to the point where it can perform tasks that had been exclusively in the domain of human intelligence.\n\nDespite that feeling of magic, an  LLM  is, in reality, a giant exercise in statistics. Prompt Chat  GPT  to finish the sentence: \u201cThe promise of large language models is that they\u2026\u201d and you will get an immediate response. How does it work?\n\nFirst, the language of the query is  converted from words, which neural networks cannot handle, into a representative set of numbers  (see graphic).  GPT  -3, which powered an earlier version of Chat  GPT  , does this by splitting text into chunks of characters, called tokens, which commonly occur together. These tokens can be words, like \u201clove\u201d or \u201care\u201d, affixes, like \u201cdis\u201d or \u201cised\u201d, and punctuation, like \u201c?\u201d.  GPT  -3\u2019s dictionary contains details of 50,257 tokens.\n\nTokenisation\n\nThe\n\n464\u200a\u200apromise\n\n6991\u200a\u200aof\n\n286\u200a\u200alarge\n\n1588\u200a\u200alanguage\n\n3303\u200a\u200amodels\n\n4981\u200a\u200ais\n\n318\u200a\u200athat\n\n326\u200a\u200athey\n\n484\n\nGPT  -3 is able to process a maximum of 2,048 tokens at a time, which is around the length of a long article in  The  Economist  .  GPT  -4, by contrast, can handle inputs up to 32,000 tokens long\u2014a novella. The more text the model can take in, the more context it can see, and the better its answers will be. There is a catch\u2014the required computation rises non-linearly with the length of the input, meaning slightly longer inputs need much more computing power.\n\nThe tokens are then  assigned the equivalent of definitions  by placing them into a \u201cmeaning space\u201d where words that have similar meanings are located in nearby areas.\n\nEmbedding\n\nfacsimile\n\nvocabulary\n\nlanguage\n\ntongue\n\nmodel\n\nreplica\n\naptitude\n\ntalent\n\nspeech\n\nduplicate\n\nimitation\n\npotentiality\n\nability\n\nrepresentation\n\npotential\n\ncapability\n\nmassive\n\nlookalike\n\npromise\n\ncapacity\n\ngreat\n\nvast\n\nhuge\n\nenourmous\n\nbig\n\nlarge\n\nThe  LLM  then deploys its \u201cattention network\u201d to make connections between different parts of the prompt. Someone reading our prompt, \u201cthe promise of large language models is that they\u2026\u201d, would know how English grammar works and understand the concepts behind the words in the sentence. It would be obvious to them which words relate to each other\u2014it is the model that is large, for example. An  LLM  , however, must learn these associations from scratch during its training phase\u2014over billions of training runs, its  attention network slowly encodes the structure of the language it sees as numbers (called \u201cweights\u201d)  within its neural network. If it understands language at all, an  LLM  only does so in a statistical, rather than a grammatical, way. It is much more like an abacus than it is like a mind.\n\nAttention\n\nThe\n\npromise\n\nof\n\nlarge\n\nlanguage\n\nmodels\n\nis\n\nthat\n\nthey\n\n22%\n\n20%\n\n18%\n\n8%\n\n12%\n\n3%\n\n9%\n\n5%\n\n2%\n\nThe\n\npromise\n\nof\n\nlarge\n\nlanguage\n\nmodels\n\nis\n\nthat\n\nthey\n\nOnce the prompt has been processed, the  LLM  initiates a response. At this point, for each of the tokens in the model\u2019s vocabulary, the attention network has produced a probability of that token being the most appropriate one to use next in the sentence it is generating. The token with the highest probability score is not always the one chosen for the response\u2014how the  LLM  makes this choice depends on how creative the model has been told to be by its operators.\n\nThe  LLM  generates a word  and then feeds the result back into itself. The first word is generated based on the prompt alone. The second word is generated by including the first word in the response, then the third word by including the first two generated words, and so on. This process\u2014called autoregression\u2014repeats until the  LLM  has finished.\n\nCompletion\n\nThe\u200a\u200apromise\u200a\u200aof\u200a\u200alarge\u200a\u200alanguage\u200a\u200amodels\u200a\u200ais\u200a\u200athat\u200a\u200athey\u200a\u200acan\u200a\u200abe\u200a\u200aused\u200a\u200ato\u200a\u200agenerate\u200a\u200atext\u200a\u200athat\u200a\u200ais\u200a\u200aindistinguishable\u200a\u200afrom\u200a\u200ahuman\n\n-\n\nwritten\u200a\u200atext\n\n.\n\nAlthough it is possible to write down the rules for how they work,  LLM  s\u2019 outputs are not entirely predictable; it turns out that these extremely big abacuses can do things which smaller ones cannot, in ways which surprise even the people who make them. Jason Wei, a researcher at Open  AI  , has counted 137 so-called \u201cemergent\u201d abilities across a variety of different  LLM  s.\n\nThe abilities that emerge are not magic\u2014they are all represented in some form within the  LLM  s\u2019 training data (or the prompts they are given) but they do not become apparent until the  LLM  s cross a certain, very large, threshold in their size. At one size, an  LLM  does not know how to write gender-inclusive sentences in German any better than if it was doing so at random. Make the model just a little bigger, however, and all of a sudden a new ability pops out.  GPT  -4 passed the American Uniform Bar Examination, designed to test the skills of lawyers before they become licensed, in the 90th percentile. The slightly smaller  GPT  -3.5 flunked it.\n\nEmergent abilities are exciting, because they hint at the untapped potential of  LLM  s. Jonas Degrave, an engineer at DeepMind, an  AI  research company owned by Alphabet, has shown that Chat  GPT  can be convinced to act like the command line terminal of a computer, appearing to compile and run programs accurately. Just a little bigger, goes the thinking, and the models may suddenly be able to do all manner of useful new things. But experts worry for the same reason. One analysis shows that certain social biases emerge when models become large. It is not easy to tell what harmful behaviours might be lying dormant, waiting for just a little more scale in order to be unleashed.\n\nPROCESS THE DATA\nThe recent success of  LLM  s in generating convincing text, as well as their startling emergent abilities, is due to the coalescence of three things: gobsmacking quantities of data, algorithms capable of learning from them and the computational power to do so (see chart).

Older, non-attention-based versions of language models would not have been able to process such a quantity of data in a reasonable amount of time. \u201cWithout attention, the scaling would not be computationally tractable,\u201d says Yoshua Bengio, scientific director of Mila, a prominent AI research institute in Quebec.\n\nThe sheer scale at which  LLM  s can process data has been driving their recent growth.  GPT  -3 has hundreds of layers, billions of weights, and was trained on hundreds of billions of words. By contrast, the first version of  GPT  , created five years ago, was just one ten-thousandth of the size.\n\nBut there are good reasons, says Dr Bengio, to think that this growth cannot continue indefinitely. The inputs of  LLM  s\u2014data, computing power, electricity, skilled labour\u2014cost money. Training  GPT  -3, for example, used 1.3 gigawatt-hours of electricity (enough to power 121 homes in America for a year), and cost Open  AI  an estimated $4.6m.  GPT  -4, which is a much larger model, will have cost disproportionately more (in the realm of $100m) to train. Since computing-power requirements scale up dramatically faster than the input data, training  LLM  s gets expensive faster than it gets better. Indeed, Sam Altman, the boss of Open  AI  , seems to think an inflection point has already arrived. On April 13th he told an audience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology: \u201cI think we\u2019re at the end of the era where it\u2019s going to be these, like, giant, giant models. We\u2019ll make them better in other ways.\u201d\n\nBut the most important limit to the continued improvement of  LLM  s is the amount of training data available.  GPT  -3 has already been trained on what amounts to all of the high-quality text that is available to download from the internet. A paper published in October 2022 concluded that \u201cthe stock of high-quality language data will be exhausted soon; likely before 2026.\u201d There is certainly more text available, but it is locked away in small amounts in corporate databases or on personal devices, inaccessible at the scale and low cost that Common Crawl allows.\n\nComputers will get more powerful over time, but there is no new hardware forthcoming which offers a leap in performance as large as that which came from using  GPU  s in the early 2010s, so training larger models will probably be increasingly expensive\u2014perhaps why Mr Altman is not enthused by the idea. Improvements are possible, including new kinds of chips such as Google\u2019s Tensor Processing Unit, but the manufacturing of chips is no longer improving exponentially through Moore\u2019s law and shrinking circuits.\n\nThere will also be legal issues. Stability  AI  , a company which produces an image-generation model called Stable Diffusion, has been sued by Getty Images, a photography agency. Stable Diffusion\u2019s training data comes from the same place as  GPT  -3 and  GPT  -4, Common Crawl, and it processes it in very similar ways, using attention networks. Some of the most striking examples of  AI  \u2019s generative prowess have been images. People on the internet are now regularly getting caught up in excitement about apparent photos of scenes that never took place: the pope in a Balenciaga jacket; Donald Trump being arrested.\n\nGetty points to images produced by Stable Diffusion which contain its copyright watermark, suggesting that Stable Diffusion has ingested and is reproducing copyrighted material without permission (Stability AI has not yet commented publicly on the lawsuit). The same level of evidence is harder to come by when examining Chat  GPT  \u2019s text output, but there is no doubt that it has been trained on copyrighted material. Open  AI  will be hoping that its text generation is covered by \u201cfair use\u201d, a provision in copyright law that allows limited use of copyrighted material for \u201ctransformative\u201d purposes. That idea will probably one day be tested in court.\n\nA MAJOR APPLIANCE\nBut even in a scenario where  LLM  s stopped improving this year, and a blockbuster lawsuit drove Open  AI  to bankruptcy, the power of large language models would remain. The data and the tools to process it are widely available, even if the sheer scale achieved by Open  AI  remains expensive.\n\nOpen-source implementations, when trained carefully and selectively, are already aping the performance of  GPT  -4. This is a good thing: having the power of  LLM  s in many hands means that many minds can come up with innovative new applications, improving everything from medicine to the law.",

Many universities now  allow students  to use generative AI in course work and assignments. Some local institutions offer free access to ChatGPT, encouraging students to use it in school.\n\nHowever, generative AI has its limitations. Because the content it produces is generated from a complex large-language model instead of logically developed and based on facts, AI sometimes \"hallucinates\", that is, produces incorrect or misleading results, due to insufficient training data, bias and incorrect assumptions. In June, two lawyers in the US  were sanctioned  for using ChatGPT to produce a legal brief with fictitious case citations. They claimed they weren't aware ChatGPT could make up cases.\n\nThis case raises an important question: how does generative AI affect human capability when people no longer need to develop logical arguments and verify facts when creating content?\n08:15\nHow a Hong Kong school embraces ChatGPT in the classroom\n\nHow a Hong Kong school embraces ChatGPT in the classroom\n\nUsing generative AI to produce work is akin to outsourcing it to other people. Thus, we can infer its impact on human capability by referencing outsourcing.\nAdvertisement\n\nWe conducted research on how contributions to the well-known programming language, Python, changed after the introduction of a crowdsourcing program called Internet Bug Bounty (IBB), which rewards people for finding security vulnerabilities in open source software  but excludes the official system maintainers, who have been reporting and fixing bugs, and making enhancements, from the reward.\nThe IBB program should have made the Python maintainers' job easier, giving them more time to perform other tasks and hence increasing their productivity in those tasks.\nDaily\n\nOpinion Newsletter\n\nThought-provoking commentary and Op-ed content, curated daily by our world-class editorial team.\n\nBy submitting, you consent to receiving marketing emails from SCMP.

The official Python maintainers not only discovered fewer bugs after the IBB program, they also made fewer enhancements to Python. This means their overall productivity fell after bug reporting was outsourced.\nWe looked at many reasons for the drop in productivity, including a loss of motivation due to not being rewarded in the IBB program. We concluded that it was mainly due to a lack of inter-task learning. There was a bigger drop in productivity among Python maintainers who reported more bugs before the IBB program than those who reported fewer. The drop was also bigger when the bug reporting and enhancement tasks were more closely related.\nAdvertisement\n\nWe surveyed a number of Python maintainers, most of whom said that finding vulnerabilities helped them learn and gain ideas for how to enhance the program. This implies that when performing a task, we not only contribute to the outcome, we learn at the same time.\n\nThis inter-task learning side-effect is illuminating. It suggests that learning and other capabilities may be sacrificed when we enjoy the power and convenience of generative AI. The short-term gain in productivity could be offset by the long-term loss in capability. Worse, this capability may be key to our contribution to future tasks, including, possibly, intelligent knowledge work.\nAdvertisement\n\nSo how should generative AI use be managed in an organisation? First, distinguish between objectives  are we seeking work output or learning and training? In most places, work output may be the priority, so it would be reasonable to actively deploy generative AI tools. Even so, we must be aware this may slow employees' learning of how to perform tasks.\n\nSecond, start classifying tasks by nature, in terms of whether they are interrelated. Generative AI tools may be better deployed for tasks that have little relation to other tasks, for example, pure automation jobs. We might wish to discourage AI's use for deeply intertwined tasks.\nAdvertisement\n\nThird, more training should be provided once generative AI is deployed. People are intrinsically lazy. If we let them use generative AI without supplementing it with learning opportunities, their ability may deteriorate over time.\n04:48\nWill ChatGPT replace reporters?

We must seek to prevent the unrestrained use of generative AI in homework or assignments. If students don't do homework themselves but outsource it entirely to AI, they may soon lose the ability to reason, innovate and produce more advanced knowledge.\nAdvertisement\n\nWe must revisit the common question, \"Why waste time doing mundane work when AI can do it for us?\" This is a dangerous sentiment because we do work not only to produce an outcome, but to learn as well. Such learning builds the foundation for future knowledge production.\nWe should not get carried away by generative AI, thinking that only work outcomes matter.

We must seek to prevent the unrestrained use of generative AI in homework or assignments. If students don\u2019t do homework themselves but outsource it entirely to AI, they may soon lose the ability to reason, innovate and produce more advanced knowledge.\nAdvertisement\n\nWe must revisit the common question, \u201cWhy waste time doing mundane work when AI can do it for us?\u201d This is a dangerous sentiment because we do work not only to produce an outcome, but to learn as well. Such learning builds the foundation for future knowledge production.\nWe should not get carried away by generative AI, thinking that only work outcomes matter. The learning itself is equally important, if not more so.\nKai-Lung Hui is Elman Family Professor of Business and senior associate dean at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Business School\nJiali Zhou is an assistant professor at the American University in Washington DC\nThe views expressed here are the authors\u2019 own\nAdvertisement",

For the most part, phone brands that sell worldwide  Apple, Google and Samsung  have settled on iterative hardware improvements year-on-year.\n\nDESIGN AND HARDWARE\n\nThe Galaxy S24 series comprises three phones: the S24, S24+ and S24 Ultra. All three have almost the exact same design as 2023's flagship Samsung phones.\nThere are subtle changes: the S24 and S24+ each get a very small increase in screen size, to 6.2 inches and 6.7 inches respectively, while the S24 Ultra's 6.8-inch display is now entirely flat, losing the curved sides that have been a signature of Samsung phones for the past eight years.\n\nThe S24 Ultra also has a new titanium frame (the other two phones in the series stick with aluminium). All three get new colours and the expected new silicon, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip.\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Ultra model also has a new periscope zoom lens, a 50-megapixel model offering 5X zoom compared to last year's 10-megapixel, 10X zoom lens. Yes, you read that right  the new lens has a shorter optical zoom range, but it's not a downgrade because it has a larger sensor and more megapixels, which allows Samsung to use in-sensor crop technology to get a lossless 10X zoom image.\nThat's mostly it as far as new hardware is concerned; everything else, from battery capacity to memory to display resolution, is mostly unchanged from the previous generation of Samsung flagship phones. The 2024 phones are almost all about software innovation.\n\nSOFTWARE AND FEATURES\nThe S24 phones ship with OneUI 6.1, an operating system based on Android 14, and it is this new software that brings all the generative AI features.\nEvery Friday\n\nDiscover news and insights on women trailblazers, social issues and gender diversity in Asia\n\nBy submitting, you consent to receiving marketing emails from SCMP. If you don't want these, tick here\n\nBy registering, you agree to our  T&C  and  Privacy Policy\n\nThe most useful one, in my opinion, is real-time two-way translation for both written text and spoken word. The latter works in phone calls. For example, I can call someone who only speaks Japanese. What I say will be translated into Japanese for them, and what they say will be translated into English (or another language) for me.\nAll of this happens on-device without the need for an internet connection, and the wait to translate is only a few seconds, so it's fast enough that it could be used in real-life scenarios.\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same translation software works in other Samsung apps, like the voice recorder or Samsung Keyboard. I could record a conversation in Mandarin, and transcribe it to French with a click of a button. Or I can type a sentence in English, and Samsung's keyboard can turn that text into Spanish before sending.\n\nRight now, the S24 phones' translation features support 13 languages, including English, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, Spanish, German and Thai. Samsung says more languages will be available in future, including Cantonese.\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother AI feature that I find quite useful is generative AI photo editing. I can remove objects in a photo or move them around and the S24 will use generative AI to fill in the missing pixels  creating entirely new portions of an image.\nThere's also the ability to turn any video shot with the S24 into a slow-motion video. This uses machine learning to create new frames (a method known as frame interpolation) so the video can move more slowly without appearing choppy.\nDuring my brief hands-on time with the phones, all the aforementioned features worked as advertised, and while it's true that none of these features are new per se  I can do these things with third-party apps or software  Samsung is putting all of them into the native UI of its phones, without the user needing to install apps, or pay for premium features, or send their data elsewhere.\n\nEARLY THOUGHTS\nAll the signs pointed to generative AI being the big buzzworthy thing this year (along with AR headsets) so it's no surprise that Samsung went all in on its new devices.\nAdvertisement\n\nI think the real-time translation and photo editing features will come in very handy, and I also welcome the Ultra's new 5X zoom lens that should be great for portraits.\nAdvertisement",

America\u2019s government seems unfazed by the possibility that such shifts might one day threaten Delaware itself. Its climate defiance grows not only from the power of its fossil-fuel industry and the scepticism of the Republican party, but also from a sense of insulation from the costs of global warming. This confidence is misplaced. New research indicates not only that climate change will impose heavy costs on the American economy, but also that it will exacerbate inequality.\nCalculating the economic effects of climate change is no simple matter. It means working out how a given increase in global temperature affects local weather conditions; how local weather affects things like mortality and crop yields; how those changes add to or subtract from regional GDP; and how thousands of local-level changes in GDP add up nationally or globally.

                            "text": "The geographic breadth of the exercise in democracy is remarkable. Elections for  the European parliament  across the European Union\u2019s member states in June will determine whether the rise in support for eurosceptic and populist parties will stymie the enlargement of the bloc. Voters in many African nations, notably South Africa, will also cast their ballots, while important municipal elections will be held in Brazil and Turkey.\n\nHowever, the immediate focus is on Asia. Indonesia will hold a crucial  presidential and parliamentary election  next month, while a  general election in India  will take place over several weeks in April and May. Both countries \u2013 whose combined population is nearly 1.7 billion people \u2013 are making high-stakes bets on brisk growth that hinge crucially on their ability to successfully exploit geopolitical realignments and renewable energy-related shifts in the global economy.\n\nThree leading Asian economies \u2013 Taiwan, India and South Korea \u2013 are heading to the polls this year. Each of them plays a crucial role in the stock markets of developing nations at a time when sentiment towards China has deteriorated sharply.\n10:34\nWhat Taiwan\u2019s presidential election will mean for China, the US and the world\n\nWhat Taiwan\u2019s presidential election will mean for China, the US and the world\n\nThe three economies have a combined weighting of 45 per cent in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, compared with mainland China\u2019s 26 per cent. It is therefore somewhat surprising that investors have barely reacted to the increase in political risk in Asia, especially in Taiwan, whose  presidential and legislative elections  are a potential flashpoint just when Beijing and Washington are trying to ease tensions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile investors often spend more time worrying about political risk than is ultimately warranted, the outcome of Taiwan\u2019s elections could have major implications for global markets. Putting aside the potential for a dramatic escalation of hostilities across the Taiwan Strait in response to a stronger-than-expected performance of the ruling  Democratic Progressive Party  , the virtual stranglehold of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) on the global chip supply chain is reason enough for investors not to be complacent.\n\nTaiwan produces 90 per cent of the world\u2019s most advanced chips, and some US technology giants, commonly referred to as the \u201c  Magnificent Seven  \u201d, rely heavily on Taiwan. Bank of America warned earlier this week that the Magnificent Seven\u2019s 30 per cent weighting in the benchmark S&P 500 index made US stocks \u201cmore sensitive than ever to any geopolitical escalation that disrupts the supply of semiconductors\u201d.\n\nDaily\n\nOpinion Newsletter\n\nThought-provoking commentary and Op-ed content, curated daily by our world-class editorial team.\n\nBy submitting, you consent to receiving marketing emails from SCMP.

Furthermore, TSMC itself has deftly straddled the geopolitical divide, with its share price up 30 per cent since the start of last year, just after Warren Buffett\u2019s conglomerate  sold the bulk of its stake  in the company because of geopolitical risks.\n\nThis partly explains why markets are calm. If anything, the geopolitical and economic centrality of Taiwan reduces the threat of a major conflict. Investors are even less concerned about the outcome of elections in India and Indonesia on the grounds that policy continuity will prevail.\nForeign inflows into the equity markets of Taiwan and India rose sharply in the last two months, buoyed by signals that the US Federal Reserve will start  cutting interest rates this year  .

Improbable, unpredictable events will almost certainly sideswipe even their best-laid plans. </div><p> From an early age, I have been convinced the force of serendipity that lies behind those sideswipes is one of life\u2019s strongest but least-recognised forces. My life has been shaped not by any vision consciously forged either by myself or my parents but a handful of serendipitous moments that came out of nowhere, forced a choice and forever altered the course of my life. </p><div> By serendipity, I don\u2019t just mean pure chance or coincidence, like the good fortune of being born into a wealthy family in a wealthy country, a last-minute decision to cancel a ticket on the Titanic or <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/social-welfare/article/3245203/cant-spend-it-all-china-lottery-winner-gives-away-bulk-us12-million-scrap-collector-donates-us140000?module=inline&amp;pgtype=article\"><span> winning the lottery </span></a> . </div></section><section><p> Neither do I mean just happy or lucky developments, though this was certainly implied by the creator of the concept, the \u201cgenial dilettante\u201d Horace Walpole. He recalled the ancient tale of the inventive travels of the Three Princes of Serendip, an ancient Persian term referring to Sri Lanka. </p><p> Most of the discussion around serendipity sees it as a lucky and positive force inspiring dramatic innovation, such as Alexander Fleming\u2019s 1928 discovery of penicillin after finding that a green fungus growing in accidentally untended Petri dishes had stifled growth of the staphylococcus bacterium. </p><div><div><div> Advertisement </div></div></div><div> However, I don\u2019t believe the positive link is inevitable.

As Louis Pasteur said in 1854: \u201cChance favours only the prepared mind\u201d.

Remember Wilhelm Roentgen, who in 1895 stumbled on X-rays as he researched cathode rays in his Wurzburg laboratory. Consider Raytheon\u2019s Percy Spencer, who in 1950 working close to a compact cavity magnetron \u2013 a high-powered vacuum tube that generates microwaves \u2013 noticed that the microwaves had melted a candy bar in his pocket, leading to the creation of the microwave oven. </p><div><div><div><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/04/04/clean-thumb.jpg?itok=ADySUL-y\"></figure><div><div><div><p> 03:12 </p><p> Happy 50th birthday to the cellphone: inventor remembers the first mobile call </p></div></div></div></div><div><div> Happy 50th birthday to the cellphone: inventor remembers the first mobile call </div></div></div></div><p> Similar serendipitous \u201caccidents\u201d have been linked with the first use of vaccines, insulin, quinine, superglue, Post-it stickers, Teflon and Velcro, not to mention radioactivity and pulsars. </p><div><div><div> Advertisement </div></div></div><p> Beyond the realm of pure science, serendipitous forces have been hard at work in all of our personal and work lives.

                            "text": "As \u201c  tiger mums  \u201d worldwide strive to engineer a successful life for their children, I have always nurtured a temptation to warn them that all those meticulously organised life plans are likely to be laid in vain. Improbable, unpredictable events will almost certainly sideswipe even their best-laid plans.\n\nFrom an early age, I have been convinced the force of serendipity that lies behind those sideswipes is one of life\u2019s strongest but least-recognised forces. My life has been shaped not by any vision consciously forged either by myself or my parents but a handful of serendipitous moments that came out of nowhere, forced a choice and forever altered the course of my life.\nBy serendipity, I don\u2019t just mean pure chance or coincidence, like the good fortune of being born into a wealthy family in a wealthy country, a last-minute decision to cancel a ticket on the Titanic or  winning the lottery  .\n\nNeither do I mean just happy or lucky developments, though this was certainly implied by the creator of the concept, the \u201cgenial dilettante\u201d Horace Walpole. He recalled the ancient tale of the inventive travels of the Three Princes of Serendip, an ancient Persian term referring to Sri Lanka.\nMost of the discussion around serendipity sees it as a lucky and positive force inspiring dramatic innovation, such as Alexander Fleming\u2019s 1928 discovery of penicillin after finding that a green fungus growing in accidentally untended Petri dishes had stifled growth of the staphylococcus bacterium.\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t believe the positive link is inevitable. Serendipity can inflict harm just as it can generate good, as anyone would know who had a family member in the World Trade Centre in New York on September 11, 2001, or lived near the  Fukushima nuclear power plant  on March 11, 2011.\n\n02:43\nA decade on, Fukushima evacuee still afraid to move back home\n\nA decade on, Fukushima evacuee still afraid to move back home\n\nMore than just being in the right or wrong place at the right or wrong time, it is what we do with unanticipated developments that unleashes truly serendipitous forces. As Louis Pasteur said in 1854: \u201cChance favours only the prepared mind\u201d. What distinguishes serendipity is not the unexpected itself but rather the combination of the unexpected with a prepared mind that detects opportunity where the inattentive see nothing.\nDaily\n\nOpinion Newsletter\n\nThought-provoking commentary and Op-ed content, curated daily by our world-class editorial team.\n\nBy submitting, you consent to receiving marketing emails from SCMP.

Its influence is the stuff of legend, seen in stories such as Archimedes and his \u201ceureka\u201d moment more than 2,000 years ago or Isaac Newton and his apple tree in the 1660s.\nThe story of serendipity in bringing about unsought findings in scientific discovery is a long and colourful one. Remember Wilhelm Roentgen, who in 1895 stumbled on X-rays as he researched cathode rays in his Wurzburg laboratory. Consider Raytheon\u2019s Percy Spencer, who in 1950 working close to a compact cavity magnetron \u2013 a high-powered vacuum tube that generates microwaves \u2013 noticed that the microwaves had melted a candy bar in his pocket, leading to the creation of the microwave oven.\n03:12\nHappy 50th birthday to the cellphone: inventor remembers the first mobile call\n\nHappy 50th birthday to the cellphone: inventor remembers the first mobile call\n\nSimilar serendipitous \u201caccidents\u201d have been linked with the first use of vaccines, insulin, quinine, superglue, Post-it stickers, Teflon and Velcro, not to mention radioactivity and pulsars.\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyond the realm of pure science, serendipitous forces have been hard at work in all of our personal and work lives. When I decided in 1968 to take a \u201cgap year\u201d rather than go directly from A-levels to university, I had no inkling of the prodigious impact this decision would have on the rest of my life.\nVoluntary Service Overseas, the British equivalent of the US Peace Corps, serendipitously  sent me to Pakistan  . After three months teaching in a school in a tribal area outside Peshawar, I decided to reapply to university, this time to study social anthropology and development economics. The decision sent alarm through my family, who could not imagine any useful career such a degree course could lead to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack to university in Britain, who could have predicted that Zhou Enlai would have sent one of the first cohorts of  Foreign Ministry recruits  to study English to live in my dormitory, seeding an interest in China that was so early that it aroused the suspicions of the UK\u2019s intelligence services?\n\nWho could have predicted that this would lead to a journalism career with the Financial Times, which brought me  here to Hong Kong  in 1983, an entirely improbable destination for a working-class kid from England\u2019s Midlands? My life has serendipity stamped all over it, and I am certain that most of us have similar stories of the profound and unanticipated impact of such serendipity on our lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is the same in business, where business schools have tried to seed the force of serendipity as a catalyst for corporate creativity and innovation as well as a foundation for competitive advantage.\nSuch efforts include attempts to create \u201cwater cooler moments\u201d or random coffee trials as stimulants for creative exchange, prompts to get us to plant \u201cserendipity hooks\u201d in our conversations or our emails and simple calls for enhanced alertness and curiosity, all aimed at incubating Pasteur\u2019s prepared mind.\nAt a  time of \u201cpolycrisis\u201d  , in which climate change, pandemic threats, wars and astonishing technology change are compounding the disruptive force of more conventional risks such as demographic change, political turmoil and unprecedented levels of debt, there is good reason to try to marshal more effectively the serendipitous forces that surround us \u2013 and only the positive ones, if possible.\n\nDavid Dodwell is CEO of the trade policy and international relations consultancy Strategic Access, focused on developments and challenges facing the Asia-Pacific over the past four decades\nAdvertisement",
