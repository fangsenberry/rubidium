original search queries refer to those that are being sourced for without intereference/whatever from the saturday call notes. The other one comes directly from what was being talked about in the sat call notes

the metadata for the searching function just follows the following for now:
its a cartesian product between all of the sets, which is to say
queries (literally each query) X websites X success/failure (for the website search) X success/failure (for the ujeebu search) X response code (for the ujeebu thing) X relevance (for the result from ujeebu) X time taken (for the ujeebu thing) + one last field for the content that it has returned. this will majorly help with footnoting.
