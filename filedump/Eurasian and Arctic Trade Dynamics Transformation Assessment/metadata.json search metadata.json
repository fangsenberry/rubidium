It\u2019s largely Russian-speaking, but not by choice. It\u2019s largely in Asia, but it has never been under Chinese rule, with the exception of Xinjiang or Uyghur territory. It\u2019s largely Turkish, but was never under the Ottomans. And that is why it\u2019s so interesting.\u201d\nContemporary art of the region \u2014 an enormous landlocked area which Slavs and Tatars defines as \u201ceast of the former Berlin Wall and west of the Great Wall of China\u201d, encompassing Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and the other \u201cstans\u201d \u2014 will be the focus of the ninth edition of the Asia Now fair in Paris (October 20-22), which Slavs and Tatars are guest curating. While gathering attention at an institutional level, there is still relatively low market demand for art from the region, in part thanks to political complexities and a cultural identity that is difficult to pin down. The fair hopes to start redressing that.\nIn the region, Kazakhstan is a dominant player. Its largest city, Almaty, is home to a number of galleries, such as Aspan. \u201cFor many European curators, art critics and collectors, an art fair like Asia Now would be their first encounter with artists from the region,\u201d says Aspan\u2019s co-founder Meruyert Kaliyeva. \u201cAs a gallery situated thousands of miles away from any centre of contemporary art, it is very important for us to participate in art fairs.\u201d\nDanagul Tolepbay, director of Pygmalion Gallery, based in Kazakhstan\u2019s capital, Astana, is joining Asia Now for the second time. The region\u2019s role in international politics, energy resources and initiatives such as China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, also known as the New Silk Road, has piqued global interest in central Asian artists in recent years, she says.\nTo Tolepbay the mistaken perception that their art is merely an extension of Russian art is finally shifting: \u201cToday we are increasingly inclined to view ourselves as integral members of the Asian region rather than being solely associated with the post-Soviet world.\u201d Pygmalion exhibits artists across different generations who have a common artistic signature: \u201cTheir works convey a spirituality that resonates regardless of your faith, and a sense of connection with history.\u201d\nNomadic culture, still present in the area up until 100 years ago, adds another layer: \u201cWe have a lot to learn today from the nomads\u2019 relationship with nature in the context of today\u2019s ecologies,\u201d says Payam, who identifies nomadism as a recurring theme in the work of central Asian artists.\nSara Raza, a central Asian art expert and author of the book  Punk Orientalism: The Art of Rebellion  , says that European museums and academic spaces have great awareness of this part of the world. \u201cFor instance, Tate curator Dina Akhmadeeva has created acquisition strategies that have enabled several regional artists to enter the collection, including multimedia artist Taus Makhacheva, who has roots in the north Caucasus.\u201d\nHowever, for the moment the growing interest among museums and collectors concerns individual artists rather than the scene as a whole. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many museums or collectors creating a \u2018central Asian collection\u2019,\u201d says Kaliyeva.\nThe central Asian art scene and society, with its contentions and complexities, its popular culture, its myths and esoteric traditions, have been Slavs and Tatars\u2019 focus for many years, from both an artistic and a curatorial standpoint. For Asia Now, the collective will create a  chaikhaneh  (tea house) and a reading room, consisting of an Eurasian-style salon with literature on the arts of the region, hosted in a Kazakh yurt in the courtyard of the Monnaie, Paris\u2019s mint.\nTheir main project will be a show featuring textile-inspired contemporary works. \u201cWe connected complex traditional and regional techniques, like ikat [a form of dyeing], with the idea of digital clouds creating virtual worlds,\u201d says Payam. The 14 artists on show will use fabric as a metaphor for the information age, with threads evoking the entangling of data as well as the intermingling of different cultural roots.\nAmong these artists are Almagul Menlibayeva, who photographs Soviet nuclear reactors to question human vulnerability and colonisation; Madina Joldybek, who creates tapestries of women\u2019s breasts to represent social pressure and the romanticisation of motherhood; Dilyara Kaipova, whose Great Cotton Road Project uses symbols from the Soviet period to denounce exploitation in the cotton industry.\n\u201cAt Asia Now we always strive to challenge a western-centric reading of art,\u201d says founder Alexandra Fain. \u201cThis includes a sharp division between arts and craft, which is more blurred in central Asia.\u201d In past editions, the fair focused on ceramics and bamboo, and this idea of breaking the barrier between high and low art, alongside other important issues in contemporary Asian art such as decolonisation, diaspora and exoticism, will be explored in a series of expert talks.\nTo Payam, art fairs such as Asia Now are instrumental in increasing momentum for emerging art scenes: \u201cOur art history going forward will be increasingly written by the market, as much as by the institutions, the scholars and the curators. That\u2019s why we need to get central Asian artists into collections,\u201d he says. \u201cCollectors will be the guardians of these works when none of us will be around.\u201d\nasianowparis.com",

For Asia Now, the collective will create a <em> chaikhaneh </em> (tea house) and a reading room, consisting of an Eurasian-style salon with literature on the arts of the region, hosted in a Kazakh yurt in the courtyard of the Monnaie, Paris\u2019s mint. </p><figure><picture><img src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Ff84ee96e-8891-4e61-92a1-04fdb4ab6245.png?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=1\"></picture><figcaption class=\"n-content-picture__caption\"><span> \u2018Breast Collection\u2019 (2021)\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. </span></figcaption></figure><figure><picture><img src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F933bef48-bb56-414b-9f6c-bf6161623948.png?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=1\"></picture><figcaption class=\"n-content-picture__caption\"><span>\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and \u2018Vinyl Record\u2019 (2023) are both by Madina Joldybek </span><span> \u00a9 Courtesy the artist (2) </span></figcaption></figure><p> Their main project will be a show featuring textile-inspired contemporary works. \u201cWe connected complex traditional and regional techniques, like ikat [a form of dyeing], with the idea of digital clouds creating virtual worlds,\u201d says Payam. The 14 artists on show will use fabric as a metaphor for the information age, with threads evoking the entangling of data as well as the intermingling of different cultural roots. </p><p> Among these artists are Almagul Menlibayeva, who photographs Soviet nuclear reactors to question human vulnerability and colonisation; Madina Joldybek, who creates tapestries of women\u2019s breasts to represent social pressure and the romanticisation of motherhood; Dilyara Kaipova, whose Great Cotton Road Project uses symbols from the Soviet period to denounce exploitation in the cotton industry. </p><figure><picture><img src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Ff17cea11-60b2-4f15-bf56-bf21ac6b8666.jpg?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=1\"></picture><figcaption class=\"n-content-picture__caption\"><span> Works by Dilyara Kaipova </span><span> \u00a9 Image courtesy CHAT. Chris Lusher </span></figcaption></figure><p> \u201cAt Asia Now we always strive to challenge a western-centric reading of art,\u201d says founder Alexandra Fain. \u201cThis includes a sharp division between arts and craft, which is more blurred in central Asia.\u201d In past editions, the fair focused on ceramics and bamboo, and this idea of breaking the barrier between high and low art, alongside other important issues in contemporary Asian art such as decolonisation, diaspora and exoticism, will be explored in a series of expert talks. </p><p> To Payam, art fairs such as Asia Now are instrumental in increasing momentum for emerging art scenes: \u201cOur art history going forward will be increasingly written by the market, as much as by the institutions, the scholars and the curators. That\u2019s why we need to get central Asian artists into collections,\u201d he says. \u201cCollectors will be the guardians of these works when none of us will be around.\u201d </p><p><a href=\"https://www.asianowparis.com/\"><em> asianowparis.com </em></a></p></article>",

When I was younger and tried writing short stories, those almost always featured a white character. It was only starting last year that I consciously veered towards books written about Asian characters, and why I decided to make all the main characters in my book Singaporean.\nOne thing that might surprise people is that I love reading Chinese historical fiction, and my favourites in this genre include Pearl S. Buck\u2019s The Good Earth and Anchee Min\u2019s Empress Orchid duology. I\u2019ve read 113 books so far this year and my favourites are My Dark Vanessa (Kate Elizabeth Russell) for fiction and Crying in H Mart (Michelle Zauner) for non-fiction. Right now, I\u2019m reading Nicola Yoon\u2019s The Sun Is Also A Star and Shelley Parker-Chan\u2019s She Who Became the Sun and really enjoying both so far.\n\nARE THERE ANY SINGAPOREAN AUTHORS IN PARTICULAR THAT YOU LOOK UP TO?\nI loved Amanda Lee Koe\u2019s Ministry of Moral Panic and Cheryl Lu-Lien Tan\u2019s Sarong Party Girl. Last Tang Standing by Lauren Ho, who is from Malaysia but now based in Singapore, was also very fun and easy to digest. The next Singlit book on my to-read list is Akshita Nanda\u2019s Beauty Queens of Bishan.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE LITERARY SCENE IN SINGAPORE AS A WHOLE?\nI think it\u2019s gotten so much more vibrant in recent years, with many up-and-coming talents in this field. Reading Singlit has opened my eyes to so many nooks and crannies of the country I thought I knew well; I\u2019m constantly learning new things about our little red dot and the people in it from both the past and present. I\u2019m also subscribed to this Telegram group that covers upcoming local literary events and there are so many of them! It\u2019s an incredibly exciting time to be a writer here.\nWHAT PROMPTED YOU TO WANT TO WRITE A NOVEL?\nThe Fraud Squad is the first book I ever wrote. I started writing it last June when I was living alone in California at the height of the pandemic, feeling very lonely and lost. I craved an escape from reality and, as I always do, I turned to books. Books that are indulgent, fun, and just very different from how despondent the world was in 2020. But with the exception of Crazy Rich Asians, most of the books in this fashion are written by white authors, with white characters and Western settings. And that was how I got the idea of writing my own book, one with Singaporean characters and settings that I could relate to \u2013 it was a way of capturing a slice of home while living alone 9000 miles away.\n\nI googled the word count of an average novel, learned it was 50k, and decided to make that my target. I never expected myself to stick with this project, so I only allowed myself to tell my family about it after I crossed the 50k mark \u2013 I figured that if I\u2019ve already written so much, it\u2019s unlikely I\u2019d give up then. Still, I kept this project very close to my chest. Before I announced my book deal, fewer than five friends even knew I had written a book.\nI definitely didn't think I was going to complete the novel. When I started it last June, I was interning full-time. And once school started in September, I became even busier, trying to complete two degrees at the same time while also interning. And there were many times when the general malaise in the world got to me: for instance, the US presidential elections; the idea I'd be graduating in a pandemic; anything to do with the pandemic; not being with my family. But writing this book was the one thing in my life that I was doing just for me, with no obligations to or expectations from anyone else, so I stuck with it.\nI finished the first draft within two months. I posted a short description of it on a writing subreddit and another Redditor reached out to me because she\u2019s also Singaporean and was drawn to the local setting of my book. She offered to give feedback and thanks to her help \u2013 and the help of other writing friends I later made\u2014my book became much stronger than what it originally was. I love how writing has introduced like-minded friends into my life.\n\nTo my surprise, I received interest from multiple publishers, so my agent set up an auction where everyone could send in bids. The auction closed at 2am because of the time zone difference between New York and Singapore, and my agent wanted to tell me the offers over a video call so she could see my live reaction.\nI chugged massive amounts of cold brew on that day so I would stay awake \u2013 that\u2019s why my agent and I call ourselves the #coldbrewmagic team now \u2013 but I quickly realised that was unnecessary because I was buzzing with so much nerves, anticipation, and excitement the entire day that it would have been impossible for me to fall asleep anyway. At 1.40am, I pulled up a 20-minute meditation video to try to calm myself down, but gave up after 2 minutes. I\u2019ve never been a pacer, but I was pacing nonstop around my room from 1.42am to 2am.\n\nBefore I got the book deal, one thing I struggled with was whether I could call myself a writer. I believe that anyone who writes  is  a writer, but since we live in a world that prizes measurable achievements, it was hard for me to tell people I was a writer when I didn\u2019t have anything to show for it \u2013 I knew that if I introduced myself as one, the natural follow-up question would be: \u201cAre you published?\u201d Now, I can call myself a writer openly, but I wish it didn\u2019t have to depend on getting a book deal.\nAM I ALLOWED TO ASK ABOUT THE FINAL BIDDING PRICE?\nPenguin Random House bought two books from me \u2013 The Fraud Squad and an unwritten second book \u2013 for six figures each.\nTELL US ABOUT THE NOVEL.\nThe Fraud Squad is about a Singaporean woman in her first year in the workforce, trying to figure out her career, her identity, and where she fits in the country's socioeconomic landscape. Samantha Song wants to break free from her family's difficult financial background and write for a high-society magazine, since the glamourous world covered by that magazine is so unlike the one she comes from.\n\nShe enlists a socialite friend and a wealthy heir to help her break into Singapore's most elite set, but gradually loses herself amid the glamour. In the end, Samantha learns that all that glitters is not gold, but finds a way to pursue her ambitions in a manner that's truer to herself.\nARE YOU A FAN OF CRAZY RICH ASIANS? HAVE YOU MET KEVIN KWAN YET?\nYes, a big fan! It\u2019s really such an entertaining and breezy read that reminds me not to take life too seriously. I wish I could meet Kevin Kwan someday \u2013 that\u2019d be so exciting.\nWHAT HAS BEEN YOUR FAMILY\u2019S REACTION TO THIS SUCCESS?\nI think they are quite bewildered by everything! There\u2019s a lot about the publishing process that is incredibly confusing, with lots of jargon thrown around. Therefore, although I did keep them updated on the major developments, I didn\u2019t tell them much so as not to overwhelm them. Also, writing this book was simply a side project for me \u2013 I didn\u2019t make a big deal out of it, so my parents didn\u2019t either, which was why they were astonished when they realised there were actually people interested in buying and publishing my book.\nThat said, they are very proud of me, and I\u2019m just really excited to dedicate this book to them once it\u2019s out! However, there are still a lot of aspects of publishing that I\u2019m trying to get them caught up on, such as why it takes so long between selling the book to the publisher and for it to actually be out in bookstores.",

                    "relevant content": "HISTORY is famously about \"maps and chaps\" while economics has become obsessed with graphs and Greek letters. In a splendidly ambitious new book, two economists, one at Columbia University and the other at Trinity College, Dublin, attempt to link the two, in a 1,000-year history of world trade.\nFor much of the past millennium, they argue, \"the pattern of trade can only be understood as being the outcome of some military or political equilibrium between contending powers.\" This was as true of Genghis Khan, whose rampages across the steppes led to the  pax Mongolica  that allowed Eurasian trade to flourish in the 13th century, as it was of the British empire which imposed free trade on large parts of Asia and Africa. Trade expansion has tended to come \"from the barrel of a Maxim gun, the edge of a scimitar, or the ferocity of nomadic horsemen\"."

This blueprint emphasises agility and adaptability to thrive in a fast-changing landscape. It also aims to anticipate emerging trends with clear thinking and judgement.\n\u201cWe live in a world characterised by volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity, and Temasek\u2019s strategy reflects the importance of staying agile and adaptable to build a resilient, forward-looking portfolio,\u201d said Ms Png Chin Yee, chief financial officer at Temasek. \u201cOur T2030 strategy is a 10-year road map that guides our strategic planning, capability-building and institutional development initiatives to help us deliver sustainable value over the long term.\u201d\n\nIn 30 seconds, see how Temasek\u2019s T2030 strategy tackles six top-of-mind global challenges \u2013 with the aim of fostering resilience and sustainable returns over the long term.\n\nIn 30 seconds, see how Temasek\u2019s T2030 strategy tackles six top-of-mind global challenges \u2013 with the aim of fostering resilience and sustainable returns over the long term. Video: Mediacorp Brand Studio\n\n1. ELEVATED PRICES, RESTRICTIVE MACRO POLICY, LOWER GROWTH: UNDERSTANDING THE FINANCIAL LANDSCAPE\nChallenge:  While inflation has fallen from its peak in 2022, interest rates and the cost of capital are expected to stay elevated in the near term relative to the past decade. Accordingly, macroeconomic policies remain largely restrictive compared to before 2021, which, in turn, raises the risk of lower growth, increased business costs and market volatility.\n\nApproach:  Temasek is building a diversified and forward-looking investment portfolio that can withstand economic shocks and market volatility. This portfolio has two components: A long-term resilient component that can provide stable and sustainable returns, or liquidity in the form of dividend income and distributions; and a shorter-term, dynamic component, where capital is recycled for investing in higher-growth opportunities for higher returns.\n\n\u201cIn doing so, we want to capitalise on growth opportunities with the potential for sustainable returns above our risk-adjusted cost of capital over the long term,\u201d said Ms Png. \u201cFor that, we must do three things. Firstly, maintain a very strong balance sheet. Secondly, protect the core of our portfolio by supporting the strategies of our portfolio companies and being an enabler for their success, and lastly, position our portfolio for growth.\u201d\n\n2. GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS & DECOUPLING IN A POST-COVID WORLD: STEERING THROUGH UNCERTAIN WATERS\nChallenge:  Shifting geopolitical dynamics can significantly impact international investments. The past decade has seen heightened tensions due to geopolitical conflicts, rivalry among the major powers, and supply chains decoupling in a post COVID-19 world.\n\nApproach:  Temasek incorporates strategic geopolitical risk assessments in its investment decisions \u2013 ensuring a pragmatic approach towards international relations. Its international policy and governance teams \u2013 located in Beijing, Brussels, Singapore and Washington DC \u2013 actively monitor geopolitical risks and consider how policy changes in key markets might affect its activities. Temasek is currently tracking the trend of decoupling and de-risking, which may disrupt global supply chains.\n\n3. TRADE AND INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS: MANAGING REGULATORY REALITIES\nChallenge:  The trade and investment regulatory environment has grown more complex as more countries adopt measures to protect national assets and critical industries. This trend is characterised by tighter trade and investment restrictions, heightened regulatory scrutiny, and greater enforcement actions. The International Monetary Fund estimates that trade restrictions will lead to global output losses of close to 2 per cent.\n\nApproach:  Temasek complies with legal and regulatory obligations across all jurisdictions it operates or invests in. The company\u2019s legal and regulatory department ensures that policies, processes and systems align with prevailing laws, and keeps abreast of regulatory developments \u2013 ensuring compliance with trade and investment, merger control, and export control regimes.\n\n\u201cAs a global investor headquartered in Singapore, Temasek\u2019s portfolio is diversified across geographies but remains anchored in Asia,\u201d noted Ms Png. \u201cThis reduces Temasek\u2019s reliance on specific markets. At the same time, we invest in companies with strong domestic demand as this can minimise the impact of trade and investment restrictions on their operations.\u201d\n\n4. SUSTAINABILITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE: AIMING FOR NET ZERO\nChallenge:  The transition to a net-zero world has faced setbacks due to concerns over energy security and affordability, which are partly due to the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war. This has momentarily slowed down decarbonisation efforts, even as the repercussions of climate change on economies and societies intensify.\n\nApproach:  Sustainability is at the core of everything that Temasek does. As a company, it has been carbon neutral since 2020. It has also set a target to reduce net carbon emissions from its portfolio to half its 2010 levels by 2030 \u2013 aiming to reach net zero by 2050.\n\nTo achieve its goals, Temasek actively participates in the acceleration of decarbonisation efforts globally. It invests in climate-aligned opportunities in the areas of food, water, waste, energy, materials, clean transportation and the built environment, while also enabling carbon-negative solutions and encouraging decarbonisation efforts in its portfolio companies. It is also catalysing financing to accelerate the adoption of green energy and decarbonisation solutions, uplifting communities through impact investing, and forming partnerships with like-minded organisations.\n\n5. CYBER RISKS: SAFEGUARDING IN THE TECHNOLOGICAL AGE\nChallenge:  The rising threat of cyberattacks poses a substantial risk to businesses and communities. Recent cybersecurity breaches serve as a timely reminder that all companies are vulnerable to such attacks, with advancements in technologies like 5G connectivity and artificial intelligence (AI) potentially exacerbating the risk.\n\nApproach:\n\n6. INDUSTRY 4.0 AND WORKFORCE 4.0: PREPARING FOR THE FUTURE\nChallenge:  Traditional operating models are being revolutionised by the emergence of Industry 4.0 \u2013 characterised by increasing automation, the employment of smart machines and the advent of human-led AI \u2013 and Workforce 4.0, which refers to a workforce that thrives in a digitally driven environment. Although Industry 4.0 has boosted economic productivity, it has also led to social challenges such as job displacements and rising inequality.\n\nApproach:\n\nExternally, Temasek supports the upskilling of employees within its portfolio companies by working with them, their unions and their workforce to understand and anticipate shifts in their respective sectors. An initiative known as the Temasek Tripartite Conversations brings together relevant government agencies, trade unions and organisations to look at the changing roles and the necessary reskilling and upskilling needs of its workers to prepare them for the jobs of the future.",

The section regarding trade and investment restrictions addresses the challenge of managing regulatory realities, specifically mentioning the complex trade and investment regulatory environment and the trend of tighter trade and investment restrictions. The approach outlined by Temasek includes compliance with legal and regulatory obligations across all jurisdictions and diversifying its portfolio across geographies to reduce reliance on specific markets, demonstrating the organization's efforts to navigate and adapt to the impact of trade restrictions on global trade. Therefore, the article contains relevant content. ",
                    "relevant content": "Temasek developed its T2030 strategy in 2019 as its compass in a complex world. This blueprint emphasises agility and adaptability to thrive in a fast-changing landscape. It also aims to anticipate emerging trends with clear thinking and judgement.\n\"We live in a world characterised by volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity, and Temasek's strategy reflects the importance of staying agile and adaptable to build a resilient, forward-looking portfolio,\" said Ms Png Chin Yee, chief financial officer at Temasek. \"Our T2030 strategy is a 10-year road map that guides our strategic planning, capability-building and institutional development initiatives to help us deliver sustainable value over the long term.\"\n\nIn 30 seconds, see how Temasek's T2030 strategy tackles six top-of-mind global challenges  with the aim of fostering resilience and sustainable returns over the long term.\n\nIn 30 seconds, see how Temasek's T2030 strategy tackles six top-of-mind global challenges  with the aim of fostering resilience and sustainable returns over the long term. Video: Mediacorp Brand Studio\n\n1. ELEVATED PRICES, RESTRICTIVE MACRO POLICY, LOWER GROWTH: UNDERSTANDING THE FINANCIAL LANDSCAPE\nChallenge:  While inflation has fallen from its peak in 2022, interest rates and the cost of capital are expected to stay elevated in the near term relative to the past decade. Accordingly, macroeconomic policies remain largely restrictive compared to before 2021, which, in turn, raises the risk of lower growth, increased business costs and market volatility.\n\nApproach:  Temasek is building a diversified and forward-looking investment portfolio that can withstand economic shocks and market volatility. This portfolio has two components: A long-term resilient component that can provide stable and sustainable returns, or liquidity in the form of dividend income and distributions; and a shorter-term, dynamic component, where capital is recycled for investing in higher-growth opportunities for higher returns.\n\n\"In doing so, we want to capitalise on growth opportunities with the potential for sustainable returns above our risk-adjusted cost of capital over the long term,\" said Ms Png. \"For that, we must do three things. Firstly, maintain a very strong balance sheet. Secondly, protect the core of our portfolio by supporting the strategies of our portfolio companies and being an enabler for their success, and lastly, position our portfolio for growth.\"\n\n2. GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS & DECOUPLING IN A POST-COVID WORLD: STEERING THROUGH UNCERTAIN WATERS\nChallenge:  Shifting geopolitical dynamics can significantly impact international investments. The past decade has seen heightened tensions due to geopolitical conflicts, rivalry among the major powers, and supply chains decoupling in a post COVID-19 world.\n\nApproach:  Temasek incorporates strategic geopolitical risk assessments in its investment decisions  ensuring a pragmatic approach towards international relations. Its international policy and governance teams  located in Beijing, Brussels, Singapore and Washington DC  actively monitor geopolitical risks and consider how policy changes in key markets might affect its activities. Temasek is currently tracking the trend of decoupling and de-risking, which may disrupt global supply chains.\n\n3. TRADE AND INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS: MANAGING REGULATORY REALITIES\nChallenge:  The trade and investment regulatory environment has grown more complex as more countries adopt measures to protect national assets and critical industries. This trend is characterised by tighter trade and investment restrictions, heightened regulatory scrutiny, and greater enforcement actions. The International Monetary Fund estimates that trade restrictions will lead to global output losses of close to 2 per cent.\n\nApproach:  Temasek complies with legal and regulatory obligations across all jurisdictions it operates or invests in. The company's legal and regulatory department ensures that policies, processes and systems align with prevailing laws, and keeps abreast of regulatory developments  ensuring compliance with trade and investment, merger control, and export control regimes.\n\n\"As a global investor headquartered in Singapore, Temasek's portfolio is diversified across geographies but remains anchored in Asia,\" noted Ms Png. \"This reduces Temasek's reliance on specific markets. At the same time, we invest in companies with strong domestic demand as this can minimise the impact of trade and investment restrictions on their operations.\"\n\n4. SUSTAINABILITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE: AIMING FOR NET ZERO\nChallenge:  The transition to a net-zero world has faced setbacks due to concerns over energy security and affordability, which are partly due to the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war. This has momentarily slowed down decarbonisation efforts, even as the repercussions of climate change on economies and societies intensify.\n\nApproach:  Sustainability is at the core of everything that Temasek does. As a company, it has been carbon neutral since 2020. It has also set a target to reduce net carbon emissions from its portfolio to half its 2010 levels by 2030  aiming to reach net zero by 2050.\n\nTo achieve its goals, Temasek actively participates in the acceleration of decarbonisation efforts globally. It invests in climate-aligned opportunities in the areas of food, water, waste, energy, materials, clean transportation and the built environment, while also enabling carbon-negative solutions and encouraging decarbonisation efforts in its portfolio companies. It is also catalysing financing to accelerate the adoption of green energy and decarbonisation solutions, uplifting communities through impact investing, and forming partnerships with like-minded organisations.\n\n5. CYBER RISKS: SAFEGUARDING IN THE TECHNOLOGICAL AGE\nChallenge:  The rising threat of cyberattacks poses a substantial risk to businesses and communities. Recent cybersecurity breaches serve as a timely reminder that all companies are vulnerable to such attacks, with advancements in technologies like 5G connectivity and artificial intelligence (AI) potentially exacerbating the risk.\n\nApproach:\n\n6. INDUSTRY 4.0 AND WORKFORCE 4.0: PREPARING FOR THE FUTURE\nChallenge:  Traditional operating models are being revolutionised by the emergence of Industry 4.0  characterised by increasing automation, the employment of smart machines and the advent of human-led AI  and Workforce 4.0, which refers to a workforce that thrives in a digitally driven environment. Although Industry 4.0 has boosted economic productivity, it has also led to social challenges such as job displacements and rising inequality.\n\nApproach:\n\nExternally, Temasek supports the upskilling of employees within its portfolio companies by working with them, their unions and their workforce to understand and anticipate shifts in their respective sectors. An initiative known as the Temasek Tripartite Conversations brings together relevant government agencies, trade unions and organisations to look at the changing roles and the necessary reskilling and upskilling needs of its workers to prepare them for the jobs of the future."

Inflation peaked at 18 per cent in April 2022 before easing to 12 per cent by December 2022.\nEven after that, some Western observers continued to insist that the sanctions were crippling the Russian economy. It is true that the sanctions have devastated certain sectors, notably aviation and auto manufacturing, which saw an 80 per cent decline in output due to lack of imported components.\nHowever, overall Russia finished 2022 with a mere 3 per cent contraction in its gross domestic product. Retail sales fell 9 per cent during the year, with local brands - along with some Chinese and Turkish companies - replacing Western companies on the domestic market.\nDespite the sanctions and setbacks on the battlefield, Putin has shown no signs of backing down. In September 2022, he  mobilised 300,000 reservists  and started a campaign to cripple Ukraine\u2019s electricity system through missile and drone attacks.\nI have studied the Soviet and the Russian economy for over four decades. I believe there are four reasons the sky has yet not fallen in on the Russian economy.\n\nRUSSIA\u2019S ENERGY LIFELINE\nRussia may be spending more than US$300 million a day to fight the war, but for much of 2022, it was earning US$800 million every day from energy exports. That revenue stream was enough to prevent living standards from collapsing and to replenish Russia\u2019s stock of arms and ammunition.\nThe war, together with Russia\u2019s cutback on gas deliveries to Europe in 2021, caused a spike in oil and gas prices. In the first month of the war, global oil prices surged 50 per cent, reaching a peak of US$139 a barrel in April, while wholesale gas prices in Europe increased 500 per cent, peaking at  \u20ac  300 (US$320) per megawatt-hour. This created windfall profits for Russia.\n\nEven though  the volume of Russian oil and gas exports to Europe fell  in 2022, its energy revenues surged to US$168 billion for the year, the highest level since 2011. Russia ended the year with a current account surplus of US$227 billion, a record high.\n\nRUSSIA HAS PLENTY OF OTHER CUSTOMERS\nSecond, the 49 sanctioning countries account for just 60 per cent of the world\u2019s economy. That leaves 40 per cent still willing to do business with Moscow.\nMost non-Western countries refused to join the sanctions. Many view the Ukraine war as a result of great power rivalry and do not blame Russia.\nIndia  and China are buying even more Russian oil and gas - though they persuaded Russia to give them a steep discount of US$20 to US$30 a barrel.  Turkey  is also a critical partner: Its trade with Russia increased 45 per cent in 2022.\nAnd despite their efforts to reduce purchases from Russia, European countries have still bought US$125 billion of Russian oil and gas since the invasion began, compared with US$50 billion by China, US$20 billion by Turkey and US$18 billion by India.\nThe Russian government has been preparing and planning for this war for many years and has learned to  live with and work around  the sanctions that were imposed after the annexation of Crimea in 2014.\nThe tumultuous 1990s taught Russian business, consumers and workers how to adapt to random shocks - such as the high inflation that wiped out many people\u2019s savings or the corporate raiders and tax police who stole businesses. Many people came to expect the worst and prepared for it. As a whole, they are both resilient in the face of challenges and resigned to lower expectations.\n\nThe Russian labour market generally absorbs shocks not by companies firing workers but paying them less until things improve. Also, 15 per cent of the workforce is made up of migrants, mainly from Central Asia - and they can be fired and sent home, then rehired as needed.\n\nOLIGARCHS AND POLICYMAKERS REMAIN LOYAL\nOne of the key political assumptions animating the initial sanctions strategy was flawed.  The theory was that the sanctioned oligarchs stood to lose tens of millions of dollars and access to their Western luxuries, and they would persuade Putin to change course to save their fortunes.\nWell, I\u2019d argue that Russia is a dictatorship, not a kleptocracy, and Putin values national power over personal wealth. The oligarchs lost half or more of their net worth, but few have publicly criticised the war. They knew that challenging Putin would mean losing their businesses in Russia, at the very least.\nMeanwhile, the \u201cliberal\u201d economists running the central bank and finance ministry - who were pivotal in helping Russia withstand the sanctions - stayed loyal. As the Financial Times put it, \u201cPutin\u2019s technocrats saved the economy to fight a war they opposed\u201d.\nSome observers hoped that the sanctions would cause ordinary Russians to rise up in protest. That did not happen. There were  protests  , but they tapered in the face of police repression, with more than 19,500 people arrested and some leaders sentenced to eight years in jail.\nThe main response of those opposing the war was to leave the country. About 500,000 have left, including many technology workers - which will undoubtedly crimp Russia\u2019s economic growth.",

Global growth is expected to hit 2.8 per cent  this year, then hover at about 3 per cent through to 2028.\nThe \u201cfog around the world economic outlook has thickened\u201d with the recent flare-up of banking turmoil in the United States and Europe, the fund said earlier this month.\nAs countries push on with tight monetary policies to battle high inflation and vulnerabilities surface in the financial system, global demand will likely stay weak, economists said.\nOne major risk for Singapore is a sharper-than-expected global slowdown, Capital Economics\u2019 Shivaan Tandon told CNA.\nThe economist expects the United States and eurozone, two of Singapore\u2019s key demand markets, to fall into recession this year.

Thailand, for example, now welcomes visitors arriving by air without requiring them to fill out a paper form, while Malaysia and Singapore require an online arrival form.\nAs a global financial hub and a city that prides itself on innovation, Hong Kong needs to keep pace with international standards.

Somewhat like Hong Kong clinging to its love of redundant fax machines and company chops!\nThe taxi industry needs to embrace competition to improve its services for paying customers. It should also allow for  electronic payments  in lieu of old-fashioned cash.\n\nNo industry can survive if it fails to understand and meet the needs of its market, as customers will seek the more efficient and effective alternative.\nAdvertisement\n\nOur taxi industry seems to believe the market should adopt what it wants, rather than adapt to what the market wants. Two decades into the 21st century, it\u2019s time the government hauled our taxi industry into the modern age.\nSimon Constantinides, Clear Water Bay\n\nGIVE INVESTORS AN INCENTIVE TO HOLD STOCKS FOR LONGER\nIn  the letter  , \u201cStock market slump signals time to put brakes on day trading\u201d (November 2), your correspondent drew attention to the notion that the day traders who appear to treat the stock market as a casino (my words) hinder \u201cthe development of the stock market\u201d. His case was that long-term investors, who are the true lifeblood of the market, are put off from buying stocks because of the wild fluctuations caused by these traders.\n\nIt so happens that on the day of the letter\u2019s publication, we had a perfect example of what your correspondent was referring to. In early trading, the index was up by close to 2 per cent, but by the end it was only up by 0.75 per cent, even though there was no real good reason for the slump to happen. It seemed that the day traders bought in the morning and sold in the afternoon.\nYour correspondent suggested implementing \u201ctime-based restrictions, such as limiting the frequency of trades within a specific time frame or imposing mandatory holding periods\u201d. These suggestions should be taken seriously.\nAnd why not reward investors who hold stocks for a lengthy period? Though dividends can be reinvested, many investors, especially the elderly, rely on the dividends to supplement what may be a meagre income, so they need to be withdrawn immediately.\nI suggest that each investor gets a bonus of 1 per cent extra when receiving a dividend, for each year of holding that stock. A person who has held Bank of China stocks for 10 years, for example, would get 10 per cent extra at each dividend payment. Even though companies would pay out more, they would benefit because the equity they raise would be much more stable and secure.\nI\u2019m not sure whether this has been done anywhere in the world. If not, Hong Kong could lead in making long-term investments more profitable, which I think would make our stock market more attractive and stable.\nChris Stubbs, Discovery Bay\nAdvertisement",

It should also allow for <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/transport/article/3240355/old-fashioned-hong-kong-taxi-industry-leader-pushes-cabs-install-e-payment-system-amid-calls-digital?module=inline&amp;pgtype=article\"><span> electronic payments </span></a> in lieu of old-fashioned cash. </div><p> No industry can survive if it fails to understand and meet the needs of its market, as customers will seek the more efficient and effective alternative. </p><div><div><div> Advertisement </div></div></div><p> Our taxi industry seems to believe the market should adopt what it wants, rather than adapt to what the market wants.

His case was that long-term investors, who are the true lifeblood of the market, are put off from buying stocks because of the wild fluctuations caused by these traders. </div><p> It so happens that on the day of the letter\u2019s publication, we had a perfect example of what your correspondent was referring to. In early trading, the index was up by close to 2 per cent, but by the end it was only up by 0.75 per cent, even though there was no real good reason for the slump to happen. It seemed that the day traders bought in the morning and sold in the afternoon. </p><p> Your correspondent suggested implementing \u201ctime-based restrictions, such as limiting the frequency of trades within a specific time frame or imposing mandatory holding periods\u201d. These suggestions should be taken seriously. </p><p> And why not reward investors who hold stocks for a lengthy period? Though dividends can be reinvested, many investors, especially the elderly, rely on the dividends to supplement what may be a meagre income, so they need to be withdrawn immediately. </p><p> I suggest that each investor gets a bonus of 1 per cent extra when receiving a dividend, for each year of holding that stock. A person who has held Bank of China stocks for 10 years, for example, would get 10 per cent extra at each dividend payment. Even though companies would pay out more, they would benefit because the equity they raise would be much more stable and secure. </p><p> I\u2019m not sure whether this has been done anywhere in the world. If not, Hong Kong could lead in making long-term investments more profitable, which I think would make our stock market more attractive and stable. </p><p><em data-qa=\"ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0\" class=\"css-1mniedq eq9i94315\"> Chris Stubbs, Discovery Bay </em></p><div><div> Advertisement </div></div></section>",

                            "text": "Dov Zakherim (Center for Strategic and International Studies):  It is good to see you again Prime Minister. Last time I saw you I had a lot more hair. I would like to ask you about the South China Sea and whether you think what has happened in Ukraine and the divisions you had spoken about, the consequences you had spoken about, are going to make any difference in what is going on in the South China Sea.\nIn other words, where do you think that is going? Is it just going to continue as it is? Or do you see any possible changes?\nPM Lee:  I think facts exists in the South China Sea. Different countries have different atolls or islands occupied, some have been reclaimed and large fortified and the claims overlap in many complicated ways. China is a claimant, four ASEAN countries are claimant states. Singapore is not one of them.\nBetween ASEAN and China, there is an ongoing longstanding dialogue on how to manage this. We have a Declaration of Conduct. We are negotiating a Code of Conduct which is supposed to be binding. It is taking a very long time, we have got a negotiating text.\nWe have got the preamble settled, but to settle a Code of Conduct is very difficult, because to define the problem is already to grapple with the problem. Which parts are in dispute? Mine are not in dispute, yours are in dispute. So, I think this is going to be a long process.\nFrom our point of view, freedom of navigation is important, international laws are important, UN Convention on the Law of the Sea is also important, and peaceful resolution of disputes, so that you avoid some accidental conflict or collision, which can escalate.\nI do not think many of the claimant states want this to go to the extreme because all of the ASEAN countries have substantial accounts with China; and the sovereignty of the South China Sea is important, but it is only one item in the broad accounts.\nMichael Mosettig (PBS Online NewsHour):  Your foreign minister has called for active mediation and for China to be invited in as a mediator on the Ukraine situation. Can China be an independent mediator given its thickening ties with Russia and the fact that many observers think that China now has a real stake in making sure that Russia is not humiliated in Ukraine?\nPM Lee:\nStephen Biegun (Macro Advisory Partners LLC):  Singapore is a leading member of some of the most important institutions in Asia - ASEAN and APEC - but there are additional institutions, and even new institutions, that are coming to the Indo-Pacific region.\nThere is AUKUS; there is the QUAD, which is not so new, but is definitely transforming; there is Five Eyes, which is also not new, but is a significant platform.\nI am just curious the view of Singapore, and do you welcome the new institutions in particular that are coming in? How do you see the role of Singapore, perhaps not in, but with some of these new institutions?\nPM Lee:  We understand why these new institutions have come into being. The US has strategic interests in the region, they want to advance these and you will make common cause with countries who will group with you in different configurations. AUKUS is one, QUAD is another; the Five Eyes has existed for a very long time, and they are part of the landscape.\nASEAN remains part of the landscape. We talk about ASEAN centrality, and if ASEAN is able to be cohesive and to play a useful role hosting the discussions and bringing parties together, then all the other pieces have their place.\nBut that is up to ASEAN. These are 10 disparate countries along a spectrum of geopolitical situations and with corresponding geopolitical strategic views.\nSo, it takes a process to bring the ASEAN consensus together and to assert itself, but I think that is what is necessary in order to have the region have a centre of gravity, which brings players together rather than pulls players apart. There are other things, which bring the countries together.\nI talked about APEC just now. The East Asia Summit is another one, which is associated with ASEAN, that includes Russia, China, America and India. And the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework \u2013 when that is created, we hope it will also be at least the basis, one day, for being an inclusive structure. And if you have those inclusive structures, then other groupings exist. Well, that is the way of the world.\nDo you see going forward that Singapore, financially, at least might benefit from greater separation from the difficulties in the Chinese financial markets?\nPM Lee:  No, we are not separated. We do business with them. They are our biggest trading partner, they have investments in Singapore, we have not small investments in China and in Hong Kong too. And we wish them well.\nAnd a lot of analysts explained why the Chinese stock market has come down, and (it) has to do with policy decisions, decisions which the Chinese government have made. I think they want to establish a new set of rules in the tech space. And they have decided that the stock market performance is a secondary consideration.\nAnd as far as their economy is concerned, so far, despite COVID, their economy has done quite robustly. And if you take a long-term view beyond COVID, we believe it has the potential to continue to be growing, developing economy with many opportunities, which we would like to continue to work with.\nHong Kong is a different specific problem because they are in a transition. And it is partly the broader China context which influences their market, but also specific situations and conditions in Hong Kong which will take some time to be resolved. We hope they will.\nFrom a narrow point of view with Hong Kong's problems, some of the companies or the people who are there, I will think of moving elsewhere in the region and may want to come to Singapore, and if they do, we will be happy to take them.\nBut from a broader point of view, it is not to our advantage to have Hong Kong languish. We are far better for us to have a robust competitor. They thrive, we thrive. We will make a living, and so will they. It is not Hertz or Avis.\nHaass:  I want to follow up on one thing that that question raised. In the United States, I would say in the foreign policy establishment or even beyond that, there is the widespread judgement that the decades-long effort to integrate China into global economic institutions largely did not succeed.\nIf the hope was to make China more open and rules abiding economically, more open politically, less aggressive in its foreign policy; that rather, China cherry picked its involvements and has emerged stronger, but not more moderate in its behaviours.\nAnd that leads to a sense here that we therefore are to become much more restrictive. Do you believe that we are learning the right lessons of history here, or are we over learning?\nPM Lee:  I think you have to see this in context. China is going to develop, China is going to grow, I think the momentum is enormous and unstoppable. Question is how can this be integrated into the global system?\nOr you can try and work with them and fit them into the global system. They benefit from it, you benefit from it. And over time, you hope that a constructive evolution will happen.\nI do not think that turning China into a democracy was ever on the cards. Nor was it the reason why we brought China into the WTO or engage with China on many fronts, but on its own merits.\nThe US economy, US consumers, US MNCs have benefited enormously from what you have done cooperating with China. From the Chinese point of view, they will say - we benefited, we grew, you benefited, your companies prospered. There is nothing to improve.\nBut well, it is true that both sides benefited, but the balance has shifted. What used to be an economy one tenth this size, has now become an economy on some measures as big as the US or maybe even bigger, if you look at the PPP.\nWhat used to be wearable arrangements, concessions, are no longer politically wearable or economically sensible. Adjustments have to be made. And you have to adjust to this situation.\nFirst, gradually, to treat China more and more as a not so developing, but more closely developed economy. But secondly, also to give it some space to influence the global system.\nFor example, shares in the IMF, or influence in the World Bank. You do not want to change your whole system of international order, or international law - this is a framework which everybody fits into. But now you have got a big player and they do want to participate and you have to enable them to participate.\nIf you do not, they will say, well, I will have my own show. I can\u2019t get into the World Bank and have a bigger vote share. I have my Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and many countries would like to join. I would like to cooperate with my neighbours, (so) let us have the Belt and Road initiative.\nIn principle, these are all the right things to do because this is a big country. You are going to want to cooperate with it. What is the mechanism of the win-win cooperation?\nIn practice, what is the difficulty? The difficulty is when a very big partner cooperates with a very small partner, it will be very difficult to find that point of balance where both are equally happy.\nKim Dozier (Time Magazine):  Kim Dozier with Time Magazine. I wanted to ask if the Biden Administration had accepted your proffered role as Beijing whisperer and also on Capitol Hill.\nPM Lee:  I am not a Beijing whisperer.\nKim Dozier (Time Magazine):  Could you be?\nPM Lee:  No, we cannot. We are not part of the family. We are Chinese, ethnic Chinese majority country in Southeast Asia. (We are) multi-racial, multi-religious, with independent national interests and priorities. And they treat us as such, and we remind them that that is so.\nKim Dozier (Time Magazine):  Then as a follow up, there is a lot of anger from the White House to the bipartisan anger on Capitol Hill over China's practices - of IP theft or investing in US companies and then pulling out and taking the ideas with them.\nWhereas, how has Singapore managed to do business with them when you are one of the least corrupt countries on the globe, with the most transparency. How do you say to Congress you can do business with them, and here's how?\nPM Lee:  Well, I think that they are two separate questions. Corruption is one problem; but intellectual property theft is a different problem.\nI know that for quite some time in the past, US companies and others too have had issues with intellectual property, either formally, being dispossessed of them, or informally, they turn up down the road in different forms.\nIf you have talked to the companies, they do tell you that the problems have not disappeared, but they have become more manageable. Because the Chinese have now got the greater interest in protecting their own intellectual property.\nBut I think what the Chinese will want to do from other countries, is what the US tried to do very hard in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and that is to pick up technology and ideas from others who have got these technologies and ideas. Just as you did it from Europe and you have benefited from any number of emigres and visitors from Europe who brought in ideas and sometimes you have your own quiet channels to obtain the information. The Chinese do that too.\nI think what gets the US Congress very upset is when you find very egregious examples which appear to have come from actors which trace back somewhere onto the mainland and then you are unable to get any recourse on that or any sympathy, or you get told, \u2018I have the same problem\u2019, and you really do not believe that answer but you are unable to do anything about it.\nOn that sort of issue, I do not think sanctions will get you very far. What you will need to do is to have a very serious conversation at very senior levels, to make it quite clear that to have stable relations, you must have trust.\nAnd if things are done which undermine that trust between the two countries - I may not be on the same page with you, I may not like you, but I need a certain basis of trust in order to do any business with you and solve problems together.\nAs George Schultz said on his 100th birthday: Trust is the coin of the realm. That is gravely lacking now and one of the reasons is this question of intellectual property theft and cyber security is a problem.\nKara Tan Bhala (Seven Pillars Institute for Global Finance and Ethics):  This is Kara Tan Bala from Seven Pillars Institute; I am a former Malaysian. In light of the climate crisis, how do you think Singapore will fare? How do you think the world will fare based on mitigation efforts so far?\nHaass:  I wish to piggyback on that, are you at all worried in that context of climate that this renewed emphasis on energy security that has grown out of the European dependence on Russian gas exports, in particular, has somehow relegated climate and pushed it off the agenda a little bit? Are you worried that we are losing valuable time here?\nPM Lee:  I am very worried about the climate. You asked me what I think about the mitigation efforts. I think honestly, they will be inadequate. The scientists are quite unambiguous. They are quite polite and hedged in their views. But their directions have consistently been more extreme than their predictions for quite some time now.\nFor Singapore, we take that very seriously, because we are a very low-lying Island. Our highest point is about the height of the Washington Monument and a bit more. If the sea levels rise, which they will, we would not be flooded overnight, but we will have floods regularly and it will become like Louisiana.\nWe are doing our own part to mitigate the measures, but it depends on the global initiatives because we are such a small part of the global output - 0.2 or 0.3 per cent of the global emissions. We have to do our part and we have to show a good example, and we are hoping to reach net-zero somewhere around the middle of the century.\nWe are trying to pin down how soon exactly that can be, but it depends on technology, and it depends on carbon markets and those are big question marks.\nAlso, it depends on the international order. If you are at war with Russia, you will not be able to agree with Russia on reducing emissions, much less apportioning responsibility for cutting carbon. I think that is going to be a big problem even if you are not at war, even with China, where you have got a dialogue and John Kerry works very hard visiting them and talking to them.\nBecause your relations are so fraught, it is very difficult to make progress and you have explicitly said you are not prepared to trade off climate against other issues. Then the Chinese say, well, what is the point of this? I think it is going to be very difficult, and we are going to fall short of their goals \u2013 and their goals themselves are not high enough \u2013 and we should prepare for that.\nCutting off dependence on Russia will, in the first place, impact Europe. But unless the Russian oil disappears from the world and they themselves do not consume it, it is going to pop up somewhere else.\nFrom the climate point of view, that does not solve the problem. From Europe's point of view, I speak out of turn, but I think without nuclear, it is very difficult for them to go to net zero. But it is not the politic to acknowledge that.\nHaass:  When you say that mitigation is never going or is unlikely to be \u2013 I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, but we cannot put all of our eggs in that basket, it is unlikely to succeed. Where does that then leave you as a government, in terms of your policy? Does that mean you put a much greater emphasis on adaptation?\nPM Lee:  First of all, mitigation, we do our part, but we know that we do not determine the outcome, and the world will not do enough. Therefore, we have to work on adaptation. If we are talking about 100-year timeframe, I have 100 years to solve the problem and I have the wherewithal to do it.\nBefore we went into COVID-19 and before we went into the Ukrainian war, I spent some time in my annual broadcast to Singaporeans talking about climate change and why it mattered to them, and I said, \u201cyou have got 100 years, if it rises 18 inches or even double that, we can live with it - you can build polders, you can build dikes, you can reclaim, raise the level, and we have the resources.\u201d\nAnd I said, \u201cS$100 billion over 100 years, we can afford that, and if we do it consistently, we will be able to survive.\u201d I still believe that, and we will do that.\nBut please understand that 100 years is not the endpoint, it is just the first milestone - this is going to continue for centuries.\nHaass:  Would you be open to supporting research and experimentation on various new technologies that would one way or another try to cool the planet? So-called\u2026\nPM Lee:  Geoengineering.\nHaass:  Would Singapore be open to at least greenlighting certain experimentation there?\nPM Lee:  We do not have an official position but personally, I would be prepared to do some pilot projects. I think that it is a very dire situation, it is one of those things where you are boiling the frog and therefore, no political system is able to respond vigorously enough because today's problems are always more urgent than the climate change challenge, and you have no solution based on today's technology and today\u2019s international infrastructure.\nSo, you do have to find new solutions, and if you have to experiment with geoengineering and put up some mirrors in the sky or even aerosols, I think that you have to think very carefully about it. You should not rule it out without thinking about it.\nSharik Zafar (Meta):  I wanted to follow up on your point about digital cooperation. There are some specific steps that you would like the United States government to encourage with respect to digital cooperation in Southeast Asia. My company has headquarters\u2026\nPM Lee:  About digital cooperation? Yes, we do encourage digital cooperation. We have a Digital Economic Partnership Agreement (DEPA) with New Zealand, Chile and Singapore \u2013 three (countries). The Chinese have applied to join, Korea too, and we are trying to encourage the US to think about such an understanding between us and the United States.\nIt is necessary because you need the framework, mutual understanding, rules - what information can be shared, where can information be stored and intellectual property questions. There is substance to this.\nI don\u2019t know if we coined the name, but we decided, we popularised the idea of a Digital Partnership Agreement to bring all these bundle together and treat it separately from traditional FTAs. That is one of the things, which I hope you will be able to do in some form in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.\nHaass:  I think there is a mis-intention there. In the politically-fraught trade space in this country, there seems to be more space to explore things in the digital domain than others.\nPM Lee:  Yes, but even there, I think there is some sensitivity because it benefits the tech companies who are presently in bad odour.\nHaass:  We will not go there. Another virtual question?\nKira Kay (Bureau for International Reporting):  I wanted to ask you about the other war in Myanmar. I appreciate the call today to release political prisoners and to implement ASEAN\u2019s Five-Point plan.\nBut Singapore is the largest foreign investor in Myanmar, including commercial ties with military-owned businesses and Singaporean banks handle the revenue from the oil and gas sector. It would seem that a resolution to the crisis would benefit Singapore besides the humanitarian need. So, what more could we expect from Singapore on the sanctions front?\nPM Lee:  With Myanmar, none of us have enormous influence on what happens within their country. These are domestic developments, they are domestically driven, it is a deep conflict between the military and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy, and it has been going on for several decades now.\nSingapore, you say that we have investments there; actually, they are not doing anything. All our people wish to get out, but they are stuck there - they cannot sell and cannot get out. Our banks handle Myanmar accounts - some of them we have prescribed, the rest of them we watch very carefully, and we make quite sure that if anything untoward happens, a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) is filed, and we will look into the matter.\nYou know perfectly well that looking for bank accounts is very difficult as a strategy to force policy change in a country, particularly in the case of a country like Myanmar, which is actually only too happy to turn inwards and close off from the rest of the world.\nSo, we do not have a lot of aggressive options, but we do try to continue to speak and encourage. The last time we did this, it took a long time, but with patience, Myanmar eventually came onto a path, which led to elections and to a civilian government, which lasted for some period. It may be necessary for us to walk that path again, and I hope the second time will not be harder.\nHaass:  Prime Minister, we want to thank you for not just being with us today, but for being so open and candid and thoughtful about many of the challenges facing not just your country, but the region in the world. Thank you.\nEditor's note: This article has been updated after some of the quotes in the provided transcript were amended.",
                            "html": "<p><strong> Dov Zakherim (Center for Strategic and International Studies): </strong> It is good to see you again Prime Minister. Last time I saw you I had a lot more hair. I would like to ask you about the South China Sea and whether you think what has happened in Ukraine and the divisions you had spoken about, the consequences you had spoken about, are going to make any difference in what is going on in the South China Sea. </p><p> In other words, where do you think that is going? Is it just going to continue as it is? Or do you see any possible changes? </p><p><strong> PM Lee: </strong> I think facts exists in the South China Sea. Different countries have different atolls or islands occupied, some have been reclaimed and large fortified and the claims overlap in many complicated ways. China is a claimant, four ASEAN countries are claimant states. Singapore is not one of them. </p><p> Between ASEAN and China, there is an ongoing longstanding dialogue on how to manage this. We have a Declaration of Conduct. We are negotiating a Code of Conduct which is supposed to be binding. It is taking a very long time, we have got a negotiating text. </p><p> We have got the preamble settled, but to settle a Code of Conduct is very difficult, because to define the problem is already to grapple with the problem. Which parts are in dispute? Mine are not in dispute, yours are in dispute. So, I think this is going to be a long process. </p><p> From our point of view, freedom of navigation is important, international laws are important, UN Convention on the Law of the Sea is also important, and peaceful resolution of disputes, so that you avoid some accidental conflict or collision, which can escalate. </p><p> I do not think many of the claimant states want this to go to the extreme because all of the ASEAN countries have substantial accounts with China; and the sovereignty of the South China Sea is important, but it is only one item in the broad accounts. </p><p><strong> Michael Mosettig (PBS Online NewsHour): </strong> Your foreign minister has called for active mediation and for China to be invited in as a mediator on the Ukraine situation. Can China be an independent mediator given its thickening ties with Russia and the fact that many observers think that China now has a real stake in making sure that Russia is not humiliated in Ukraine? </p><p><strong> PM Lee: </strong></p><p><strong> Stephen Biegun (Macro Advisory Partners LLC): </strong> Singapore is a leading member of some of the most important institutions in Asia - ASEAN and APEC - but there are additional institutions, and even new institutions, that are coming to the Indo-Pacific region. </p><p> There is AUKUS; there is the QUAD, which is not so new, but is definitely transforming; there is Five Eyes, which is also not new, but is a significant platform. </p><p> I am just curious the view of Singapore, and do you welcome the new institutions in particular that are coming in? How do you see the role of Singapore, perhaps not in, but with some of these new institutions? </p><p><strong> PM Lee: </strong> We understand why these new institutions have come into being. The US has strategic interests in the region, they want to advance these and you will make common cause with countries who will group with you in different configurations. AUKUS is one, QUAD is another; the Five Eyes has existed for a very long time, and they are part of the landscape. </p><p> ASEAN remains part of the landscape. We talk about ASEAN centrality, and if ASEAN is able to be cohesive and to play a useful role hosting the discussions and bringing parties together, then all the other pieces have their place. </p><p> But that is up to ASEAN. These are 10 disparate countries along a spectrum of geopolitical situations and with corresponding geopolitical strategic views. </p><p> So, it takes a process to bring the ASEAN consensus together and to assert itself, but I think that is what is necessary in order to have the region have a centre of gravity, which brings players together rather than pulls players apart. There are other things, which bring the countries together. </p><p> I talked about APEC just now. The East Asia Summit is another one, which is associated with ASEAN, that includes Russia, China, America and India. And the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework \u2013 when that is created, we hope it will also be at least the basis, one day, for being an inclusive structure. And if you have those inclusive structures, then other groupings exist. Well, that is the way of the world. </p><p> Do you see going forward that Singapore, financially, at least might benefit from greater separation from the difficulties in the Chinese financial markets? </p><p><strong> PM Lee: </strong> No, we are not separated. We do business with them. They are our biggest trading partner, they have investments in Singapore, we have not small investments in China and in Hong Kong too. And we wish them well. </p><p> And a lot of analysts explained why the Chinese stock market has come down, and (it) has to do with policy decisions, decisions which the Chinese government have made. I think they want to establish a new set of rules in the tech space. And they have decided that the stock market performance is a secondary consideration. </p><p> And as far as their economy is concerned, so far, despite COVID, their economy has done quite robustly. And if you take a long-term view beyond COVID, we believe it has the potential to continue to be growing, developing economy with many opportunities, which we would like to continue to work with. </p><p> Hong Kong is a different specific problem because they are in a transition. And it is partly the broader China context which influences their market, but also specific situations and conditions in Hong Kong which will take some time to be resolved. We hope they will. </p><p> From a narrow point of view with Hong Kong's problems, some of the companies or the people who are there, I will think of moving elsewhere in the region and may want to come to Singapore, and if they do, we will be happy to take them. </p><p> But from a broader point of view, it is not to our advantage to have Hong Kong languish. We are far better for us to have a robust competitor. They thrive, we thrive. We will make a living, and so will they. It is not Hertz or Avis. </p><p><strong> Haass: </strong> I want to follow up on one thing that that question raised. In the United States, I would say in the foreign policy establishment or even beyond that, there is the widespread judgement that the decades-long effort to integrate China into global economic institutions largely did not succeed. </p><p> If the hope was to make China more open and rules abiding economically, more open politically, less aggressive in its foreign policy; that rather, China cherry picked its involvements and has emerged stronger, but not more moderate in its behaviours. </p><p> And that leads to a sense here that we therefore are to become much more restrictive. Do you believe that we are learning the right lessons of history here, or are we over learning? </p><p><strong> PM Lee: </strong> I think you have to see this in context. China is going to develop, China is going to grow, I think the momentum is enormous and unstoppable. Question is how can this be integrated into the global system? </p><p> Or you can try and work with them and fit them into the global system. They benefit from it, you benefit from it. And over time, you hope that a constructive evolution will happen. </p><p> I do not think that turning China into a democracy was ever on the cards. Nor was it the reason why we brought China into the WTO or engage with China on many fronts, but on its own merits. </p><p> The US economy, US consumers, US MNCs have benefited enormously from what you have done cooperating with China. From the Chinese point of view, they will say - we benefited, we grew, you benefited, your companies prospered. There is nothing to improve. </p><p> But well, it is true that both sides benefited, but the balance has shifted. What used to be an economy one tenth this size, has now become an economy on some measures as big as the US or maybe even bigger, if you look at the PPP. </p><p> What used to be wearable arrangements, concessions, are no longer politically wearable or economically sensible. Adjustments have to be made. And you have to adjust to this situation. </p><p> First, gradually, to treat China more and more as a not so developing, but more closely developed economy. But secondly, also to give it some space to influence the global system. </p><p> For example, shares in the IMF, or influence in the World Bank. You do not want to change your whole system of international order, or international law - this is a framework which everybody fits into. But now you have got a big player and they do want to participate and you have to enable them to participate. </p><p> If you do not, they will say, well, I will have my own show. I can\u2019t get into the World Bank and have a bigger vote share. I have my Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and many countries would like to join. I would like to cooperate with my neighbours, (so) let us have the Belt and Road initiative. </p><p> In principle, these are all the right things to do because this is a big country. You are going to want to cooperate with it. What is the mechanism of the win-win cooperation? </p><p> In practice, what is the difficulty? The difficulty is when a very big partner cooperates with a very small partner, it will be very difficult to find that point of balance where both are equally happy. </p><figure><img src=\"https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--25nQ1RDs--/c_crop,h_843,w_1500,x_0,y_158/c_fill,g_auto,h_98,w_175/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2021-08:cna,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2022/03/30/image_from_ios.jpg?itok=raRATTU3\"></figure><figure><img src=\"https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--1nVHve3o--/c_fill,g_auto,h_98,w_175/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2021-08:cna,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2022/03/30/image_from_ios_7.jpg?itok=RHkRmqBK\"></figure><p><strong> Kim Dozier (Time Magazine): </strong> Kim Dozier with Time Magazine. I wanted to ask if the Biden Administration had accepted your proffered role as Beijing whisperer and also on Capitol Hill. </p><p><strong> PM Lee: </strong> I am not a Beijing whisperer. </p><p><strong> Kim Dozier (Time Magazine): </strong> Could you be? </p><p><strong> PM Lee: </strong> No, we cannot. We are not part of the family. We are Chinese, ethnic Chinese majority country in Southeast Asia. (We are) multi-racial, multi-religious, with independent national interests and priorities. And they treat us as such, and we remind them that that is so. </p><p><strong> Kim Dozier (Time Magazine): </strong> Then as a follow up, there is a lot of anger from the White House to the bipartisan anger on Capitol Hill over China's practices - of IP theft or investing in US companies and then pulling out and taking the ideas with them. </p><p> Whereas, how has Singapore managed to do business with them when you are one of the least corrupt countries on the globe, with the most transparency. How do you say to Congress you can do business with them, and here's how? </p><p><strong> PM Lee: </strong> Well, I think that they are two separate questions. Corruption is one problem; but intellectual property theft is a different problem. </p><p> I know that for quite some time in the past, US companies and others too have had issues with intellectual property, either formally, being dispossessed of them, or informally, they turn up down the road in different forms. </p><p> If you have talked to the companies, they do tell you that the problems have not disappeared, but they have become more manageable. Because the Chinese have now got the greater interest in protecting their own intellectual property. </p><p> But I think what the Chinese will want to do from other countries, is what the US tried to do very hard in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and that is to pick up technology and ideas from others who have got these technologies and ideas. Just as you did it from Europe and you have benefited from any number of emigres and visitors from Europe who brought in ideas and sometimes you have your own quiet channels to obtain the information. The Chinese do that too. </p><p> I think what gets the US Congress very upset is when you find very egregious examples which appear to have come from actors which trace back somewhere onto the mainland and then you are unable to get any recourse on that or any sympathy, or you get told, \u2018I have the same problem\u2019, and you really do not believe that answer but you are unable to do anything about it. </p><p> On that sort of issue, I do not think sanctions will get you very far. What you will need to do is to have a very serious conversation at very senior levels, to make it quite clear that to have stable relations, you must have trust. </p><p> And if things are done which undermine that trust between the two countries - I may not be on the same page with you, I may not like you, but I need a certain basis of trust in order to do any business with you and solve problems together. </p><p> As George Schultz said on his 100th birthday: Trust is the coin of the realm. That is gravely lacking now and one of the reasons is this question of intellectual property theft and cyber security is a problem. </p><p><strong> Kara Tan Bhala (Seven Pillars Institute for Global Finance and Ethics): </strong> This is Kara Tan Bala from Seven Pillars Institute; I am a former Malaysian. In light of the climate crisis, how do you think Singapore will fare? How do you think the world will fare based on mitigation efforts so far? </p><p><strong> Haass: </strong> I wish to piggyback on that, are you at all worried in that context of climate that this renewed emphasis on energy security that has grown out of the European dependence on Russian gas exports, in particular, has somehow relegated climate and pushed it off the agenda a little bit? Are you worried that we are losing valuable time here? </p><p><strong> PM Lee: </strong> I am very worried about the climate. You asked me what I think about the mitigation efforts. I think honestly, they will be inadequate. The scientists are quite unambiguous. They are quite polite and hedged in their views. But their directions have consistently been more extreme than their predictions for quite some time now. </p><p> For Singapore, we take that very seriously, because we are a very low-lying Island. Our highest point is about the height of the Washington Monument and a bit more. If the sea levels rise, which they will, we would not be flooded overnight, but we will have floods regularly and it will become like Louisiana. </p><p> We are doing our own part to mitigate the measures, but it depends on the global initiatives because we are such a small part of the global output - 0.2 or 0.3 per cent of the global emissions.

It discusses the status of computer hacking in international law and the challenges in defining cyber-espionage, cybercrime, and cyber-warfare. Additionally, it touches upon the difficulty in preventing cyber-attacks and the complexities involved in attributing attacks to specific actors and nations. This is relevant to the user's query as it provides insights into the evolving nature of cyber threats and the associated security implications for trade.\n\n",
                    "relevant content": "I  n 1928 many  countries signed the Kellogg-Briand pact, which outlawed war. Though often derided as hopelessly idealistic, it had important consequences. Until then, war had been a lawful way for states to settle their differences; by contrast, economic sanctions were illegal. After the second world war, the document served as the legal basis for the Nuremberg trials. A draft of the  United Nations charter  included its terms almost verbatim.\nThe status of computer hacking in international law is now similarly irrational. Espionage is basically legal; interfering in the internal affairs of another state is not. Yet when does cyber-espionage tip into  cybercrime or even cyber-warfare  ? If definitions are slippery, preventing cyber-attacks is even harder. They can be ordered by one country, perpetrated by a civilian in a second, using computers in a third to disable those in a fourth, with tracks hidden along the way. To some, the prefix \"cyber\" suggests the associated wrongs are as resistant to regulation as old-fashioned war can seem to be."

And still others, more plausibly, see it as a shot across the bow to remind big Chinese companies that the Communist Party of China is still in charge.\nBut, most consequentially, the Chinese government\u2019s actions are part of a broader effort to decouple China from the United States \u2013 a development that could have grave global implications.\nDespite steady deterioration in Sino-American economic and strategic relations, few thought the rivalry would turn into a Cold War-style geopolitical confrontation.\nFor a time, the US was overly dependent on China, and the two economies were too closely intertwined. Now, we may be heading toward a fundamentally different equilibrium.\n\nECHOES OF THE COLD WAR\nThree interrelated dynamics defined the Cold War. The first, and perhaps most important, was ideological rivalry. The US-led West and the Soviet Union had different visions of how the world should be organised, and each tried to propagate its vision, sometimes by nefarious means.\nThere was also a military dimension, illustrated most vividly by a nuclear-arms race. And both blocs were eager to secure the lead in scientific, technological and economic progress, because they recognised that this was critical to prevailing ideologically and militarily.\nWhile the Soviets eventually proved less successful than the US in driving economic growth, they did chalk up early technological-military victories. The successful launch of the Sputnik satellite served as a wake-up call for the US.\nThe stark rivalries of the Cold War were possible largely because the US and the Soviet Union were decoupled. US investments and technological breakthroughs did not automatically flow to the Soviets (except, sometimes, through espionage) in the way that they have with China in recent decades.\nBut now, Sino-American hostilities, exacerbated by Donald Trump\u2019s incoherent diplomacy, have created modern analogues of the Cold War rivalries.\n\nTHE COSTS OF DECOUPLING\nSome observers have welcomed the new rivalry, believing that it will give the West a well-defined common purpose. The \u201cSputnik moment\u201d, after all, motivated the US government to invest in infrastructure, education and new technologies.\nA similar mission for public policy today might yield many benefits; indeed, the Biden administration has already begun to frame US investment priorities in terms of the Sino-American rivalry.\nIt is true that many of the West\u2019s Cold War-era success stories depended on the Soviet Union serving as a foil. Western Europe\u2019s model of social democracy was viewed as a palatable alternative to Soviet-style authoritarian socialism.\nSimilarly, market-driven growth in South Korea and Taiwan owes much to the threat of communism, which forced governments to eschew overt repression, undertake land reforms, and invest in education.\nAnd yet, the potential benefits of a new Sputnik moment are probably far outweighed by the costs of decoupling. In today\u2019s interdependent world, global cooperation is fundamental.\nThe rivalry with China, though essential to the defense of democracy around the world, is not the West\u2019s sole priority. Climate change also poses a civilisational threat, and it will require close China-US collaboration.\n\nMoreover, commentators nowadays tend to downplay the Cold War\u2019s tremendous costs. If the West now lacks credibility when advocating human rights and democracy \u2013 including in Hong Kong and China \u2013 that is not only because of a generation of disastrous military interventions in the Middle East.\nDuring the years when the US thought that it was locked in an existential conflict with the Soviets, it toppled democratically elected governments in Iran (1953) and Guatemala (1954), and supported vicious dictators like Joseph Mobutu in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Augusto Pinochet in Chile.\nIt is an equally grave mistake to think that the Cold War fostered international stability. On the contrary, the nuclear arms race and brinkmanship on both sides prepared the ground for war.\nThe Cuban Missile Crisis was hardly the only time that the US and the Soviets came close to open conflict (and mutually assured destruction). There were also close calls in 1973, during the Yom Kippur War; in 1983, when Soviet early-alert systems sent a false alarm about a US intercontinental ballistic missile launch; and on other occasions.",

Additionally, it highlights China's role as the largest bilateral creditor to developing nations and the impact of its debt policies on global markets. Moreover, it addresses the impact of global headwinds, financial challenges faced by financially weaker countries, and the need for debt restructuring.

                    "relevance explanation": "The article discusses the impact of geopolitical tensions, trade barriers, and shifting supply chains on the global automotive industry. It specifically mentions the souring of relations between America and China leading to rising geopolitical tensions, new trade barriers, a subsidy race, shifting supply chains, and tighter restrictions on access to Western technology and data-sharing. These factors directly relate to the influence of geopolitics on global markets, as they affect international trade and business operations. Therefore, the article contains relevant content related to the query.\n\nExplanation: The article discusses the impact of geopolitical tensions, trade barriers, shifting supply chains, and tighter restrictions on access to Western technology and data-sharing on the global automotive industry, directly relating to the influence of geopolitics on global markets.",
                    "relevant content": "T  HE WORLD'S  carmakers are nowadays perforce learning from Chinese car firms and their customers what the future might look like. Similarly, Chinese carmakers are trying to understand what they need to do to conquer the West. Just as big firms have engineering and design centres in China, so do Chinese firms in America and Europe. But even as foreign carmakers begin to struggle in China, Chinese hopes of selling millions of cars abroad may fall foul of a deteriorating political landscape. A souring of relations between America and China means rising geopolitical tensions, new trade barriers, a subsidy race, shifting supply chains and tighter restrictions on access to Western technology and data-sharing. These could even add up to the deglobalisation of what is in many ways the archetypal global industry.\nThe dwindling market share of foreign firms in China owes much to the perception that the software in their electric vehicles is not as advanced as in their Chinese competitors. Sales of  VW  's  ID  series of  EV  s in China have disappointed. Slowing  EV  sales as government subsidies were cut prompted Tesla to slash prices, triggering a price war at the start of 2023 that hit less coveted  EV  s from foreign carmakers. Growing nationalist sentiment among Chinese buyers and greater efforts by the government to encourage domestic firms such as  BYD  will make China an even harder place to do business in future."

                            "text": "In the final instalment of  a three-part series  produced with support from the Judith Neilson Institute for Journalism and Ideas, Forkast.News looks at the geopolitical implications of China\u2019s technological lead in blockchain and digital currency. Parts 1 and 2 were published on  June 28  and  June 29  .\nJohn Chen has viewed the rise of the cashless economy on a split screen. On one side, the China of his birth, a place where paper fiat has all but gone extinct, even in far-flung villages. On the other, the US state of California, where he attended high school and now majors in computer science at a state university, where paper currency remains common.\nRaised in Fujian to tech-entrepreneurial parents, Chen is in many ways a quintessential modern Chinese. With a comparative eye, he has been following the development of his country\u2019s unique consumer culture for half a decade.\n\u201cWhen I visited China in 2016, I was like, \u2018Wow!\u2019 Everyone is  using WeChat Pay and Alipay  . Nobody had a purse or a wallet,\u201d he said.\n\nBusinesses requested that he paid digitally, which he much preferred to using credit cards. \u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t like [carrying a wallet] because I\u2019ve already lost my wallet three times in five years,\u201d he said, most recently during the height of Covid-19 restrictions in the US Without cash, credit cards or his driving licence, he had to ask a friend to lend him money and drive him to Target so he could \u201cgrab some chicken for dinner,\u201d he said.\n\nNow back East taking remote classes, Chen will have a front-row seat for the next stage of China\u2019s evolution. Beijing is widely expected to launch its central bank digital currency at the 2022 Winter Olympics in February.\nUnlike Alipay and WeChat Pay, however,  the digital yuan  gives Chen pause. His reasons offer a preview of debates that will only grow with the rise of all CBDCs in the coming years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned because I feel like [government officials] would be able to see all my transaction details,\u201d said Chen. \u201cI would lose part of my privacy and I don\u2019t think I would be 100 per cent happy with that.\u201d\nOf course, Alipay and WeChat are already connected to the government (and have even assisted in the development of the digital yuan) such as with ID verification procedures tied to state cameras. The linkage grows the larger the transaction, as it does virtually anywhere financial institutions have reporting requirements. But having private companies as a buffer from direct state access to his user data makes a difference to Chen.\nChina\u2019s controversial social credit system  \u2013 which monitors and scores citizens on their trustworthiness \u2013 has raised concerns over how the state might use the e-CNY to further monitor its people, control dissent and incentivise or dissuade certain behaviours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to see how the digital yuan could aid in the development of the social credit system, with stricter controls rather than looser controls,\u201d said Ian Wittkopp, a Hong Kong analyst for Sino Global Capital.\n\nIn Washington DC, the debate about digital currencies reflects the multiple roles played by money \u2013 not just as a means of payment, but a symbol of political power and the values imposed by that power.\nDaily, Monday to Friday\n\nChina at a Glance Newsletter\n\nYour daily must-read of essential stories from China, including politics, economy and current affairs.\n\nBy submitting, you consent to receiving marketing emails from SCMP.

Christopher Giancarlo, delivered a warning to the Senate Banking and Finance Subcommittee.\n\u201cThe stakes of the contest for the future of digital money are as high as any of the transformational technological revolutions of the past one hundred years,\u201d Giancarlo testified. \u201cWe are indeed entering a new world. The question is who will design and build those digital systems \u2026 and what social values will be brought to bear.\u201d Privacy, free enterprise, free speech and democracy are all at risk, he later elaborated.\nAdvertisement\n\nThrough the banking communications system Swift, the US functionally has a hand on the spigot of global capital flows \u2013 a power that Washington has used in recent years to sanction Venezuela, Iran, Syria, North Korea and a number of individuals.\n\nGiancarlo told the senators that the more widely the digital yuan is adopted, the greater its ability to bypass Swift and help other states do the same. This, he said, could increase the chance of war.\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong technocrats, however, there is less hyperbole. Tommaso Mancini-Griffoli, a division chief of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said at the Coindesk Consensus conference in May that generally speaking, \u201ca world with more than one reserve currency is a more stable world.\u201d\nOf course, whether CBDCs will prove successful remains to be seen. While China is steadily digging the trenches to global acceptance through its Digital Silk Road and  Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)  , the ultimate proof will be mass adoption.\n\nAs Chen showed, ordinary Chinese have mixed opinions. Tab Liu was born and raised in central Henan province.\nAdvertisement\n\nLike Chen, he now studies at a university in California, where he double majors in earth sciences and international relations. The grandson of peasant farmers, Liu attended middle and high school 150 miles from home. Nearly a decade later, he is effusive about the BRI infrastructure project that made it possible for him to pursue a better education.\n\u201cWe have the best high-speed railway system,\u201d he said. A distance that still takes 21 hours to traverse in the US, such as Chicago to New York City, takes just five in China.\nLiu takes a similar pride in the rise of a  cashless economy  . \u201cIn the last five years, I have not carried any cash in China,\u201d he said. Whether the digital currency he uses is directly connected to the state does not concern him. \u201cThe Chinese government is very prudent about financial problems. As long as they officially launch the digital currency, it is highly likely to be mature and secure,\u201d he said. \u201cAll people have lost privacy in this information era,\u201d Liu added, and offered examples of US encroachments on privacy.\n\nRichard Byworth, CEO of Singapore-based Eqonex, a digital-asset financial services company, said that in his custodial business, \u201cChinese clients based in Hong Kong and European clients mainly in Switzerland prefer dealing with [non-U. S.] financial institutions. There\u2019s a sensitivity around having assets in the US and what that may mean sometime in the future if geopolitics were to become an issue in some way.\u201d\nAdvertisement\n\nHe cited the regulatory environment and governmental reach during recent administrations as the causes of this wariness.\nByworth also points to more purely economic factors undermining trust in fiat money in general. He sees government efforts to support citizens during the pandemic as driving people to cryptocurrencies, an  entirely private form of money  . \u201cWhen you see that 40 per cent of all dollars outstanding were printed during the pandemic, you can understand why people are looking to assets like bitcoin to protect their wealth against this devaluation,\u201d he said.\n\nBitcoin reached an all-time high of US$64,000 in April, soon after passage of the  US$1.9 trillion stimulus bill  known as the  American Rescue Plan Act  of 2021.\n\nThis has implications for the digital dollar.  US Federal Reserve  chairman Jerome Powell in May said the US is considering the pros and cons of developing a digital dollar while \u201ccarefully monitoring and adapting\u201d to the rise of digital payment systems and private currencies, like bitcoin. While Powell has said in the past that the US would not be drawn into a CBDC race with China, he notably did not mention China in his address to the American public, which was recorded and posted on YouTube.\n\nThe contrast between the two superpowers\u2019 CBDC activity is stark. While the US is \u201cstill at the stage of planning to talk about talking about it,\u201d as Stanley Chao, a Los Angeles-based consultant on economic trends in Asia, put it, China is marshalling all of its considerable resources to usher the world toward its sweeping, holistic vision of the future.\nHow life may change is already coming into focus about 100km southwest of Beijing, where the Chinese have begun building what President Xi Jinping in 2017 called the \u201c  city of the future  .\u201d In Xiongan, many of China\u2019s development initiatives have come together: fiat digital currency, Belt and Road infrastructure, and most of all,  blockchain technology that underpins it all  .\n\nPicture a newly opened 19-track high-speed rail terminal that sends commuters to Beijing, 250km away, in 50 minutes. It\u2019s a green city, with land use and development capped at 30 per cent. And it\u2019s the first \u201csmart city\u201d to have  blockchain built into its core technological  infrastructure.\n\nRecently, Xiongan signed a contract with a Beijing start-up, S-Labs, to make blockchain applications for food safety, project supervision, and procurement and bidding.\nFrom her close view of a smart city in development, S-Labs CEO Stacey Zhou said the significance of building a city with blockchain cannot be underestimated.\n\u201cXiongan is special, it\u2019s like a blank paper we can draw or write anything on,\u201d she said. \u201cWe built it on a digital chain so the real city and digital city are being built at the same time, for the first time ever. Every single data is supported by blockchain. It is real, recorded and inalterable.\u201d\n\nXiongan has used blockchain applications to pay billions of yuan for construction materials as well as to compensate migrant workers and residents who had to be resettled, all without the fraud or misappropriation that often plagues large public works.\nA transformation is imminent, Zhou said. More cities will be built on blockchain, and existing cities will be retrofitted with it.\nShe believes the CBDC will be an integral part of life in Xiongan. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t understand the technology but this is the future and the future is coming,\u201d she said. \u201cOpen your mind.

How will they adapt to a changing Arctic Council?\nWhether the Arctic Council can continue its work on environmental protection and sustainable development without Russia\u2019s participation remains debatable, given the decades-long tradition of scientific collaboration between nations in this region, which include Russia.\n\nThe Arctic Council, despite uncertainty, has developed a way of working where it was able to catalyse legally binding agreements between the Arctic states and with non-Arctic states. These agreements include one on search and rescue in 2011, on oil spills in 2013, on scientific cooperation in 2017, and on a polar code in 2017. In 2021, an agreement to prevent unregulated commercial fishing in the central Arctic Ocean came into force, binding countries such as China, South Korea and Japan.\nAdvertisement\n\nImportantly, the Arctic Council is still the only permanent forum for cooperation in the region and has played an important role in protecting its environment and promoting sustainable development.\nThe observer states have remained active and continue to articulate their official strategies and to pay senior-level official visits to the region.

The article discusses the involvement of various Asian countries, including China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and India, in the Arctic region and their interests in Arctic governance and resources, as well as their engagement with Russia in Arctic development. It specifically mentions China's involvement in the Arctic LNG 2 project in northern Siberia, stating that Chinese companies providing modules to Russia's Arctic LNG 2 project had to stop work for eight months due to transport uncertainties and sanctions. Additionally, it highlights Japan and South Korea's common interest in shipping through the Arctic and Japan's stake in the Sakhalin-1 LNG project with Russia. Furthermore, the article addresses India's evolving Arctic policy and its commitment to the development of the Northern Sea Route to supply Russian energy to India. Therefore, the article is relevant to the user's query.\n\nExplanation",
                    "relevant content": "Climate change has made the Arctic and its potential resources more accessible. This has changed the geopolitical landscape, and more countries are now focused on the Arctic, including in distant Asia. For China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and India, their observer status ensures that they are involved in determining the future of the Arctic, a region they believe will affect their economic interests and the environment.\nAfter these five states were granted observer status in May 2013, South Korea was the first to release an official Arctic policy, updating it five years later in 2018. Japan, whose Arctic initiatives were first documented in its 2013 Basic Plan on Ocean Policy, put out its official Arctic Policy in October 2015.\nChina issued its  Arctic Policy white paper  in January 2018, articulating its interest in, among others, Arctic governance and resources, shipping opportunities and polar research. Singapore has released no official policy but its interest in Arctic governance is known, given the Northern Sea Route's potential challenge to Singapore's shipping hub status, and the island nation's concerns about melting sea ice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, in March last year, India published its long-awaited Arctic policy, showing an understanding of the major tendencies in Arctic geopolitics and business.\nFor all five Asian states, the Ukraine crisis has not just changed their engagement in the Arctic region but also with Russia. After the  2014 Crimea crisis  strained Russia's relations with the West, Moscow has viewed Beijing as its primary source of capital for Arctic development.\n\nEvery Friday\n\nDiscover news and insights on women trailblazers, social issues and gender diversity in Asia\n\nBy submitting, you consent to receiving marketing emails from SCMP.

But with China being seen as giving Russia an economic lifeline amid Western sanctions, some Chinese state banks have  limited their financing  of the purchase of Russian commodities.\n\nA likely scenario is that China will be able to maintain some energy imports but at a lower level. Under the threat of sanctions and amid transport uncertainties, Chinese companies providing modules to Russia's Arctic LNG 2 project in northern Siberia have  had to stop work  for eight months.\n\nCompared to China, less discussion has been devoted to the responses of Japan and  South Korea  . In light of the sanctions on Russia, none of the three countries, which have a common interest in shipping through the Arctic, conducted a single voyage through Russia's Northern Sea Route last year. But Japan, which is highly dependent on energy imports, has  kept its stake  in the Sakhalin-1 LNG project with Russia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, there is growing recognition among Russian decision-makers that what Russia offers China is no longer indispensable  China can find alternative cooperation partners with other Arctic states.\n\nBut Russia may also seek investment from other Asian states - for instance, India. The Indian government has appeared eager to take advantage of \"distress sales\" of Russian energy assets, such as when ExxonMobil decided to give up its stake in the Sakhalin-1 project. India has long wanted to reduce its dependence on energy imports from the Middle East.\nAdvertisement\n\nIndia's Arctic policy has taken an unmissable geopolitical turn since late 2017, evolving from a largely science-only approach to committing itself to the development of the Northern Sea Route, primarily to supply  Russian energy to India  .\n\n01:38\n'Fundamental obligation': India's foreign minister snubs Western sanctions on Russian oil\n\n'Fundamental obligation': India's foreign minister snubs Western sanctions on Russian oil\n\nWhatever their losses or gains, the five Asian states face similar questions on their role in the Arctic Council, whose consensus-based governance structure no longer functions. Will a hotly debated \"Arctic Council 2.0\" gain support among non-Arctic states with a deep interest in Arctic governance?\nAdvertisement\n\nWill these Asian observers  which have growing Arctic interests and have contributed much to Arctic research  welcome the opportunity to establish a more solid role in this region's affairs? How will they adapt to a changing Arctic Council?\nWhether the Arctic Council can continue its work on environmental protection and sustainable development without Russia's participation remains debatable, given the decades-long tradition of scientific collaboration between nations in this region, which include Russia.\n\nThe Arctic Council, despite uncertainty, has developed a way of working where it was able to catalyse legally binding agreements between the Arctic states and with non-Arctic states. These agreements include one on search and rescue in 2011, on oil spills in 2013, on scientific cooperation in 2017, and on a polar code in 2017. In 2021, an agreement to prevent unregulated commercial fishing in the central Arctic Ocean came into force, binding countries such as China, South Korea and Japan.\nAdvertisement\n\nImportantly, the Arctic Council is still the only permanent forum for cooperation in the region and has played an important role in protecting its environment and promoting sustainable development.\nThe observer states have remained active and continue to articulate their official strategies and to pay senior-level official visits to the region. But scholarship in these states needs to move beyond questions on their role in the changing Arctic Council, and start to examine their engagement in a globalised Arctic in flux.\nNong Hong, PhD, is executive director and senior fellow at the Institute for China-America Studies (US)\nAdvertisement"

                            "text": "With all this in mind, the International Baccalaureate (IB) \u2013 considered by many to be the world\u2019s most forward-thinking secondary school curriculum provider \u2013 believes that students can use AI to bolster their education and become better learners, thinkers and workers.\n\u201cThe IB believes that this AI technology will become part of our everyday lives \u2013 like spell checkers, translation software and calculators,\u201d says Matt Glanville, head of assessment principles and practice at the IB. \u201cWe therefore need to adapt and transform our educational programmes and assessment practices so that students can use these new AI tools ethically and effectively. The IB is not going to ban the use of such software but will work with schools to help them support their students on how to use these tools ethically, in line with our principles of academic integrity.\u201d\n\nThe IB\u2019s official policy as of now is that students are allowed to quote from content created by ChatGPT in their essays and other graded assessments, but similar to quotes or materials adapted from outside sources, it must be credited in the body of text and appropriately referenced in the bibliography.\n\u201cWork produced by artificial intelligence tools \u2013 even only in part \u2013 will not be considered as a student\u2019s own,\u201d Glanville explains. \u201cIt must be clear that AI-generated work included in a piece of assessment has been taken from such software. If not, the student would be misrepresenting content as it was not originally written by them.\u201d\nAdvertisement\n\nGlanville understands that the emergence of ChatGPT will cause students to \u201ctest the boundaries\u201d of what is acceptable and what is plagiarism. However, this phenomenon is something that IB has been dealing with since its inception.\n\u201cThe issue of students being disempowered to think, whether because of too much support in completing their work or asking someone else to write it for them, is a long-standing variation of current issues that the IB is familiar with managing,\u201d adds Glanville, who noted that IB teachers frequently have to deal with cases of essays bought from the internet from \u2018essay mills\u2019.\nSign up for our Newsletters\n\nFind out more\n\n\u201cOf course, these new technologies are significantly different in terms of speed, ease of access and scale, but the problem of students getting someone else to write their work for them has existed for many years.\u201d\nBecause IB coursework requires frequent check-in meetings between students and educators, it is essential for the latter to ask students to expand on ideas that they have written about to ensure the work is actually their own. Glanville adds it is also important to pay attention to students\u2019 workflow and watch them develop their work over a period of time. It is also up to the teacher\u2019s best judgment to notice whether a student is suddenly producing work far beyond his/her regular capabilities within a very short period of time.\nAll that being said, ChatGPT also presents incredible educational opportunities which the IB has fully embraced. More importantly, most people expect the use of advanced AI software to be routine within a few years, and it is important to prepare students to be able to thrive in that kind of environment, both in the workplace and even within their personal lives. It is therefore up to educators to equip students with the necessary life skills and understanding.\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cStudents will need more expertise in identifying and addressing bias,\u201d Glanville says. \u201cAll work produced by AI is based on the information it has \u2018learned\u2019 from, and particularly in today\u2019s internet this is heavily biased by its human authors. Students need to understand that AI will inherit the bias and blind spots of its programmers, or source material in the case of self-learning systems.\u201d\nHe adds that IB students may be asked to evaluate AI-produced essays and refine the prompts \u2013 the question(s) that are fed into ChatGPT to produce the work \u2013 to get the essay closer to what they want. Just as with AI art software, a small tweak to a prompt can dramatically alter what ChatGPT ultimately produces. Creating good prompts, therefore, is a valuable skill in itself.\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cStudents will continue to learn to think around problems and be creative, rather than seeking simple answers or following a routine process,\u201d Glanville says. \u201cEven today, AI tools can complete the latter more quickly and effectively, while creative problem-solving is where students can excel.\u201d\nChatGPT is still an extremely new phenomenon, having been released in November of last year. As such, the IB\u2019s policies are still evolving, and will continue to evolve accordingly.\n\nA BALANCED RESPONSE\n\u201cIn summary, we believe AI is not a crisis in education or assessment, but it does create significant challenges and opportunities,\u201d Glanville adds. \u201cIn the short term, we must teach students the ethical use of AI for assessments and the IB is well placed with assessment tasks that focus on understanding and not the coherence of written answers. However, in the medium to longer term, IB education practices will need to evolve as these types of tools improve and become a significant part of everyday life.\u201d\nAdvertisement\n\nRegardless of the policies the IB has in place, it will be up to schools and teachers to learn, adapt and become students\u2019 role models on how to use AI in an ethical way.\nFortunately for Hong Kong, it has some of the best IB schools and teachers in the world. Even though ChatGPT has been slower to catch on in the city because it still cannot be accessed without using a VPN, schools have started hosting discussions and workshops to remain a step ahead on the issue.\n\nRyan Yue, director of educational technology at American School Hong Kong (ASHK), called the eventual prominence of ChatGPT and similar software in the classroom \u201cinevitable\u201d.

If not, the student would be misrepresenting content as it was not originally written by them.\u201d </p><div><div><div> Advertisement </div></div></div><p> Glanville understands that the emergence of ChatGPT will cause students to \u201ctest the boundaries\u201d of what is acceptable and what is plagiarism. However, this phenomenon is something that IB has been dealing with since its inception. </p><p> \u201cThe issue of students being disempowered to think, whether because of too much support in completing their work or asking someone else to write it for them, is a long-standing variation of current issues that the IB is familiar with managing,\u201d adds Glanville, who noted that IB teachers frequently have to deal with cases of essays bought from the internet from \u2018essay mills\u2019. </p><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div> Sign up for our Newsletters </div></div><div><a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/newsletters\"> Find out more </a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p> \u201cOf course, these new technologies are significantly different in terms of speed, ease of access and scale, but the problem of students getting someone else to write their work for them has existed for many years.\u201d </p><figure><blockquote data-qa=\"Component-StyledBlockquote\" class=\"css-ehz5s0 exv1azg3\"> Students need to understand that AI will inherit the bias and blind spots of its programmers, or source material in the case of self-learning systems </blockquote><figcaption data-qa=\"Component-StyledFigcaption\" class=\"css-118so8m exv1azg2\"> Matt Glanville, IB </figcaption></figure><p> Because IB coursework requires frequent check-in meetings between students and educators, it is essential for the latter to ask students to expand on ideas that they have written about to ensure the work is actually their own. Glanville adds it is also important to pay attention to students\u2019 workflow and watch them develop their work over a period of time. It is also up to the teacher\u2019s best judgment to notice whether a student is suddenly producing work far beyond his/her regular capabilities within a very short period of time. </p><p> All that being said, ChatGPT also presents incredible educational opportunities which the IB has fully embraced. More importantly, most people expect the use of advanced AI software to be routine within a few years, and it is important to prepare students to be able to thrive in that kind of environment, both in the workplace and even within their personal lives. It is therefore up to educators to equip students with the necessary life skills and understanding. </p><div><div><div> Advertisement </div></div></div><p> \u201cStudents will need more expertise in identifying and addressing bias,\u201d Glanville says. \u201cAll work produced by AI is based on the information it has \u2018learned\u2019 from, and particularly in today\u2019s internet this is heavily biased by its human authors. Students need to understand that AI will inherit the bias and blind spots of its programmers, or source material in the case of self-learning systems.\u201d </p><p> He adds that IB students may be asked to evaluate AI-produced essays and refine the prompts \u2013 the question(s) that are fed into ChatGPT to produce the work \u2013 to get the essay closer to what they want. Just as with AI art software, a small tweak to a prompt can dramatically alter what ChatGPT ultimately produces. Creating good prompts, therefore, is a valuable skill in itself. </p><div><div><div> Advertisement </div></div></div><p> \u201cStudents will continue to learn to think around problems and be creative, rather than seeking simple answers or following a routine process,\u201d Glanville says. \u201cEven today, AI tools can complete the latter more quickly and effectively, while creative problem-solving is where students can excel.\u201d </p><p> ChatGPT is still an extremely new phenomenon, having been released in November of last year. As such, the IB\u2019s policies are still evolving, and will continue to evolve accordingly. </p><h3><strong data-qa=\"ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0\" class=\"css-1mniedq eq9i94316\"> A balanced response </strong></h3><p> \u201cIn summary, we believe AI is not a crisis in education or assessment, but it does create significant challenges and opportunities,\u201d Glanville adds. \u201cIn the short term, we must teach students the ethical use of AI for assessments and the IB is well placed with assessment tasks that focus on understanding and not the coherence of written answers. However, in the medium to longer term, IB education practices will need to evolve as these types of tools improve and become a significant part of everyday life.\u201d </p><div><div><div> Advertisement </div></div></div><p> Regardless of the policies the IB has in place, it will be up to schools and teachers to learn, adapt and become students\u2019 role models on how to use AI in an ethical way. </p><p> Fortunately for Hong Kong, it has some of the best IB schools and teachers in the world.

                            "text": "WASHINGTON : Last year, a veteran Silicon Valley software executive took the helm of a startup in his native China, company records show. The startup told potential investors it would sell microchip design software that is mostly available from just a handful of large Western companies.\nThe coveted and highly specialized software tool, known by its initials of OPC, is used in the design of many microchips and is crucial to the design of advanced chips.\nThe production of advanced chips is one of the most contentious technological struggles now dividing the United States and China as they vie for economic and military supremacy. Washington is trying to curb China's access to sensitive microchip design tools.\nThe strategy behind the startup, dubbed SEIDA, shows why that containment effort is so challenging.\nBefore becoming chief executive of SEIDA, Liguo \"Recoo\" Zhang had lived in the United States long enough to secure permanent residency and purchase a Silicon Valley home, according to people familiar with his career and public records reviewed by Reuters.\nHe was employed by Siemens EDA, a U.S. unit of German industrial giant Siemens AG that dominates the market in China for the very technology SEIDA told investors it planned to sell there. At least three other Chinese-born colleagues from Siemens EDA joined Zhang at SEIDA.\nIn a 2022 business-plan presentation prepared for investors, SEIDA called OPC \"indispensable technology\" and said it would offer the tool by early 2024. A Chinese version of the product, SEIDA said, would \"break through the foreign monopoly,\" helping China become self-reliant in chip technology. SEIDA's ultimate goal, according to one slide: \"Become OPC leader in the world.\"\nThe pitch attracted powerful Chinese investors.\nOne backer, recent corporate filings reviewed by Reuters show, is an investment arm of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, or SMIC. The state-backed, Shanghai-based company is China's leading maker of microchips. U.S. companies are restricted by Washington from providing technology to SMIC without a special license because its alleged work with China's military is considered a threat to American national security.\nSMIC didn't respond to Reuters' requests for comment about the investment or the U.S. restrictions.\nOn a recent visit to SEIDA's headquarters in Hangzhou, in eastern China, a receptionist told Reuters that Zhang wasn't available for an interview. In an email after the visit, Peilun \"Allen\" Chang, SEIDA's chief operating officer, said the prospectus reviewed by Reuters is \"obsolete.\"\nThe company's objectives have evolved, he wrote, adding that its backers are primarily \"private institutions and individuals.\" Chang declined to specify how much capital SEIDA has raised or what products it now aims to pursue, saying its business plan remains \"under continuous evaluation.\"\nSiemens EDA, in a statement, confirmed Zhang's departure and that of three other colleagues. The company said it considers SEIDA \"a potential competitor\" but declined to comment further.\nReuters couldn't determine whether SEIDA has progressed toward selling OPC, short for optical proximity correction. The software is commonly employed for the design of many microchips and is part of a broader set of technologies known as electronic design automation, or EDA. The tools can help design chips that could advance strategic new technologies like artificial intelligence, quantum computing and hypersonic flight.\nSince SEIDA's launch in October 2021, the U.S. government has increased efforts to curb China's access to EDA tools, developed and sold mostly by American companies.\nThrough export controls and other restrictions, Washington aims to prevent China from obtaining know-how that could allow it to match microchip advances by the United States and its allies, including Taiwan, the self-governing island claimed by China and the world's leading chip manufacturer.\nIn email exchanges with Reuters, Chang said U.S. restrictions were one of the reasons Zhang and his colleagues left Siemens EDA for SEIDA to begin with. The restrictions, he wrote, limited their business opportunities at Siemens EDA, \"diminishing scope for career advancement and involvement in key projects.\"\nSEIDA adheres to U.S. and Chinese rules, Chang added.\nNeither SEIDA nor its executives have been accused of wrongdoing. And Reuters has no evidence SEIDA is using knowledge or technology that could be considered proprietary by Siemens EDA or others. Chang said SEIDA has \"a stringent vetting process\u2026ensuring no infringement upon the intellectual property of others.\"\nExperts in the sector, and people familiar with efforts by Beijing to outmaneuver U.S. curbs on technology transfer, say SEIDA's launch follows a pattern of Chinese companies building upon foreign know-how. Even if the SEIDA executives didn't take property from their previous employer, the technologies involved are so complex that only years of experience with existing purveyors would allow them to offer similar products.\n\"Developing OPC from scratch without access to any existing intellectual property would be challenging in this timeframe, to say the least,\" said Jan-Peter Kleinhans, director of technology and geopolitics at Stiftung Neue Verantwortung, a Berlin think tank where he has researched China's market for EDA tools.\nThe story of SEIDA, which hasn't been previously reported, illustrates the challenges the West faces in thwarting Chinese development of advanced microchip technology. Despite Washington's efforts to slow China's acquisition of chip technology, Beijing is rushing to foster domestic development, attract expert expatriates to come home and overcome its lag in the sector.\nA spokesperson for China's foreign ministry said in a statement that the United States \"abuses export control measures\" and \"applies illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction to Chinese companies.\"\nChina, the spokesperson added, has adopted laws to protect intellectual property and \"complies with internationally accepted rules.\" Technological advances in China, the statement continued, \"are not the result of theft, nor of robbery, but are the result of Chinese people's ingenuity and hard work.\"\nAmerican officials have repeatedly said that Chinese efforts to secure Western technology pose one of the biggest long-term threats to the economy and security of the United States. They have expressed particular concern about China's ability to employ advanced chips, and the powerful processors they enable, for its fast-growing military.\n\"At no point have export controls been more central to our national security,\" Matthew Axelrod, assistant U.S. commerce secretary for export enforcement, said at a Congressional hearing in Washington this month.\nThe Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said such concerns reflect \"a Cold War and hegemonic mentality.\"\nWhile export rules may delay Beijing's progress, industry experts say, they are unlikely to stunt China's development of chip technology. \"The U.S. is lying across the tracks in an effort to stop the Chinese, but it is just going to become a speed bump,\" said Michael Bruck, a former general manager in China for chipmaker Intel Corp. \"It will push China to be more independent.\"\nChina's government has made its drive for more sophisticated chips a centerpiece of its strategic plans.\nLast year, after Washington announced new restrictions, Beijing said the government would spend $143 billion to spur China's domestic chip sector. Through a separate program known as \"Thousand Talents,\" the government offers employment, housing, and other incentives for Chinese experts who return from science and tech jobs abroad.\nThe program, in existence for more than a decade, has been criticized by Washington because it is viewed by some as a mechanism for China to illegally obtain intellectual property from abroad.\nLast May, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested a California-based software engineer on trade secrets charges. In an FBI affidavit related to the case, investigators said the engineer, Liming Li, had stolen millions of files from two unidentified U.S. employers.\nOne of the employers, the affidavit shows, found a folder on Li's laptop containing documents related to \"Thousand Talents.\" The pilfered company files, the FBI alleged, included unspecified materials related to \"national security, nuclear nonproliferation and anti-terrorism.\"\nLi has pleaded not guilty. His attorney, Daniel Olmos, declined to comment.\nReuters this year has chronicled the race between the West and China for dominance in sectors ranging from killer robots to undersea cables to encryption of digital communications. The struggle for primacy in chipmaking will help determine who triumphs in these technologies and others that will become available once faster processors are developed to enable them.\n\"THE LIMITS OF PHYSICS\"\nSince the 1950s, America's pioneering of chip technology played a major role in the country's creation of the world's largest economy, powerful high-tech and financial sectors, and a thus-far unparalleled military. But China's fast economic growth, and its stated ambition to assert its place as a global power, is now challenging that dominance.\nIn the Cold War, Washington blocked exports of some raw materials that Eastern Bloc countries could have used to develop weaponry. At the time, such measures succeeded because countries behind the Iron Curtain were already economically isolated.\nNow, though, globalization has made most industries far more interconnected. Semiconductors, an approximately $600 billion a year business, are no exception. From raw materials to design to assembly, chips are a global industry.\n\"The United States is not going to be able to cut the Chinese off like we did the Soviets,\" said James Andrew Lewis, director of the strategic technologies program at the Center for Strategic & International Studies, or CSIS, a Washington think tank.\nAn ambition both countries share is self-reliance in the manufacture of advanced microchips.\nAlthough the United States still leads in many of the technologies needed to design chips, most of the actual printing and assembly happens in Asia. The United States relies heavily on South Korea for memory chips and Taiwan for logic chips. Memory chips store and retrieve information and logic chips process data and execute instructions.\nLast year, the United States approved nearly $53 billion for \"CHIPS for America,\" a program, administered by the Commerce Department, that offers financial incentives to companies that can increase domestic production. Recipients of the incentives are restricted from sharing sensitive technologies with China and other countries not allied with the United States.\nAmong the challenges for China to create more advanced chips is access to EDA tools, such as the OPC software touted by SEIDA in early marketing.\nProducing the fastest, most capable chips and circuit boards involves designing and printing them with billions of ever-smaller transistors. To achieve such microscopic connections, EDA helps lay out and verify the design of these circuits and simulate how they'll perform under real-world conditions.\nBut EDA tools require intense processing power.\nSo specialized is the technology that some advances are marketed as scientific breakthroughs. NVIDIA Corp, the California-based company that is the leading supplier of chips for artificial intelligence, in March said recent advances in OPC technology would help it push the semiconductor industry \"to the limits of physics.\"\nDespite U.S. export controls, China is making advances.\nIn 2019, the Commerce Department placed Huawei Technologies Co, the Chinese telecommunications giant, on its list of companies that can't buy U.S. technologies unless the vendor obtains a special license. As with SMIC, blacklisted by the department a year later, the U.S. cited national security concerns.\n\"Our export controls on China are designed to massively slow down technology acquisition,\" Thea D. Rozman Kendler, assistant commerce secretary for export administration, said at the recent Congressional hearing.\nStill, Huawei in August introduced a new 5G smartphone with a sophisticated, seven-nanometer chip manufactured by SMIC. The phone, unveiled while U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo was visiting China, was announced to great fanfare. The Commerce Department later said it is investigating whether the two companies relied on restricted U.S. technologies to develop the chip.\nHuawei declined to comment.\nProving the source of some technologies can be challenging.\nMany semiconductor advances build upon existing intellectual property. And the turnover of personnel within the industry, especially across international borders, can make it difficult to investigate export violations or pursue claims of intellectual property theft. \"You can't really control what's in people's brains with any export controls,\" said Lewis of CSIS.\nAlon Raphael, chief executive of a California company that sells a tool to detect semiconductor defects, said he learned that lesson the hard way. Until 2020, he said, FemtoMetrix Inc, was the sole supplier of the technology, which it spent a decade developing.\nBut late that year, Raphael said, Chongji Huang, a key employee, resigned and emerged later in China with a Shanghai-based startup that offers a similar product. \"I had heard these kinds of stories,\" Raphael told Reuters, \"but I said to myself, 'No, not that guy, he's my friend.'\"\nLate last year, FemtoMetrix filed suit in California against the startup. Robert Shwarts, an attorney representing Huang and his startup, Weichong Semiconductor Group, told Reuters that neither Huang nor the startup took anything from FemtoMetrix, nor did they violate any trade secrets.\n\"ENABLE CHIP SUCCESS\"\nSEIDA, the startup managed by Siemens EDA veterans, is one of many Chinese tech startups founded in recent years to meet Beijing\u2019s call for a stronger domestic semiconductor industry.\nThe proliferation can be hard to track.\nRecent changes to Chinese regulations restrict access to company registries. Reuters couldn't determine whether China's government had any role in SEIDA's launch or whether Zhang, the chief executive, or his colleagues received any state incentives to leave Siemens EDA and work there.\nReporters reviewed some of SEIDA's corporate filings with the help of two companies that collect and analyze Chinese business records \u2013 Datenna, of the Netherlands, and Global Data Risk, based in New York. Combined with interviews and public records, the filings, dating back to October 2021, enabled Reuters to piece together some of SEIDA's history so far.\nSEIDA, the filings show, is majority-owned by partnerships now controlled by Zhang and some of the former Siemens EDA colleagues who joined him. It isn't clear when those partnerships were established or by whom. Records show the partnerships invested in SEIDA in November 2021 \u2013 weeks after the startup's launch and before Zhang left Siemens EDA.\nZhang's path toward SEIDA began at Mentor Graphics Corp, the predecessor company to Siemens EDA, acquired by Munich-based Siemens in 2017. Mentor, started in Oregon in 1981, was an early innovator of EDA and eventually became one of three U.S. companies that sell most of the software worldwide. By the time of its acquisition, Mentor boasted annual revenues of $1.2 billion.\nWith a masters degree in microelectronics from a Shanghai university, Zhang worked for more than a decade at Mentor and Siemens EDA, according to SEIDA\u2019s 2022 presentation to investors. Before joining the startup, he was a Siemens EDA product director.\nZhang is now 44 years old, according to U.S. and Chinese records. He became chief executive of SEIDA in July 2022, according to the SEIDA filings.\nReuters found that at least three other Chinese-born colleagues who joined Zhang were also longtime employees of Siemens EDA. Two of them, Zhitang \"Tim\" Yu and Yun Fei \"Jack\" Deng, earned doctorates from U.S. universities, academic records show. Born in China, Yu is also an American citizen, according to U.S. records. Deng, also born in China, obtained legal permanent resident status in the United States.\nSEIDA declined to make Deng or Yu available for interviews.\nUnder the new export restrictions, U.S. citizens and permanent residents can face penalties if they help Chinese companies develop or manufacture advanced chips without a license. Those penalties can include citations, fines or prison time, depending on the violation.\nChang, the chief operating officer, said by email: \"We continuously monitor both emerging and existing regulations to ensure our operations align with applicable legal standards.\"\nAs they sought investors last year, SEIDA executives aimed high. In the 2022 slideshow, they projected the company could be worth as much as 700 million yuan, or $99 million, by the end of last year. By 2026, they said, SEIDA hoped to sell shares to the public.\nTheir efforts attracted at least one important backer.\nIn June 2023, SEIDA received undisclosed funding from China Fortune-Tech Capital Co, or CFTC, an investment vehicle owned by chipmaker SMIC, according to records compiled by Datenna and PitchBook Data Inc, a U.S.-based corporate research company. CFTC didn't respond to requests for comment.\nSEIDA continues to secure investors. This month, according to its corporate filings, five more investors, including four Chinese venture capital firms, acquired stakes in the company.\nChang wouldn't say if the ongoing review of SEIDA's business plan means a departure from its early marketing of OPC. \"Due to the confidential nature of our business strategies, specific details of our current and future plans cannot be disclosed,\" Chang wrote.\nDuring Reuters' visit to SEIDA headquarters, the reception desk bore the same branding as the early fundraising presentation. The SEIDA name, according to the slideshow, is an acronym for \"Semiconductor Intelligent Design Automation.\" Its slogan, in the branding and on SEIDA's website, translates to \"enable chip success.\"\n(This story has been refiled to remove duplicate dateline)\n(Additional reporting by Engen Tham in Shanghai, David Lague in Hong Kong, and Michael Martina in Washington.

The state-backed, Shanghai-based company is China's leading maker of microchips. U.S. companies are restricted by Washington from providing technology to SMIC without a special license because its alleged work with China's military is considered a threat to American national security. </p><p> SMIC didn't respond to Reuters' requests for comment about the investment or the U.S. restrictions. </p><p> On a recent visit to SEIDA's headquarters in Hangzhou, in eastern China, a receptionist told Reuters that Zhang wasn't available for an interview. In an email after the visit, Peilun \"Allen\" Chang, SEIDA's chief operating officer, said the prospectus reviewed by Reuters is \"obsolete.\" </p><p> The company's objectives have evolved, he wrote, adding that its backers are primarily \"private institutions and individuals.\" Chang declined to specify how much capital SEIDA has raised or what products it now aims to pursue, saying its business plan remains \"under continuous evaluation.\" </p><p> Siemens EDA, in a statement, confirmed Zhang's departure and that of three other colleagues. The company said it considers SEIDA \"a potential competitor\" but declined to comment further. </p><p> Reuters couldn't determine whether SEIDA has progressed toward selling OPC, short for optical proximity correction. The software is commonly employed for the design of many microchips and is part of a broader set of technologies known as electronic design automation, or EDA. The tools can help design chips that could advance strategic new technologies like artificial intelligence, quantum computing and hypersonic flight. </p><p> Since SEIDA's launch in October 2021, the U.S. government has increased efforts to curb China's access to EDA tools, developed and sold mostly by American companies. </p><p> Through export controls and other restrictions, Washington aims to prevent China from obtaining know-how that could allow it to match microchip advances by the United States and its allies, including Taiwan, the self-governing island claimed by China and the world's leading chip manufacturer. </p><p> In email exchanges with Reuters, Chang said U.S. restrictions were one of the reasons Zhang and his colleagues left Siemens EDA for SEIDA to begin with. The restrictions, he wrote, limited their business opportunities at Siemens EDA, \"diminishing scope for career advancement and involvement in key projects.\" </p><p> SEIDA adheres to U.S. and Chinese rules, Chang added. </p><p> Neither SEIDA nor its executives have been accused of wrongdoing. And Reuters has no evidence SEIDA is using knowledge or technology that could be considered proprietary by Siemens EDA or others. Chang said SEIDA has \"a stringent vetting process\u2026ensuring no infringement upon the intellectual property of others.\" </p><p> Experts in the sector, and people familiar with efforts by Beijing to outmaneuver U.S. curbs on technology transfer, say SEIDA's launch follows a pattern of Chinese companies building upon foreign know-how. Even if the SEIDA executives didn't take property from their previous employer, the technologies involved are so complex that only years of experience with existing purveyors would allow them to offer similar products. </p><p> \"Developing OPC from scratch without access to any existing intellectual property would be challenging in this timeframe, to say the least,\" said Jan-Peter Kleinhans, director of technology and geopolitics at Stiftung Neue Verantwortung, a Berlin think tank where he has researched China's market for EDA tools. </p><p> The story of SEIDA, which hasn't been previously reported, illustrates the challenges the West faces in thwarting Chinese development of advanced microchip technology. Despite Washington's efforts to slow China's acquisition of chip technology, Beijing is rushing to foster domestic development, attract expert expatriates to come home and overcome its lag in the sector. </p><p> A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry said in a statement that the United States \"abuses export control measures\" and \"applies illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction to Chinese companies.\" </p><p> China, the spokesperson added, has adopted laws to protect intellectual property and \"complies with internationally accepted rules.\" Technological advances in China, the statement continued, \"are not the result of theft, nor of robbery, but are the result of Chinese people's ingenuity and hard work.\" </p><p> American officials have repeatedly said that Chinese efforts to secure Western technology pose one of the biggest long-term threats to the economy and security of the United States. They have expressed particular concern about China's ability to employ advanced chips, and the powerful processors they enable, for its fast-growing military. </p><p> \"At no point have export controls been more central to our national security,\" Matthew Axelrod, assistant U.S. commerce secretary for export enforcement, said at a Congressional hearing in Washington this month. </p><p> The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said such concerns reflect \"a Cold War and hegemonic mentality.\" </p><p> While export rules may delay Beijing's progress, industry experts say, they are unlikely to stunt China's development of chip technology. \"The U.S. is lying across the tracks in an effort to stop the Chinese, but it is just going to become a speed bump,\" said Michael Bruck, a former general manager in China for chipmaker Intel Corp. \"It will push China to be more independent.\" </p><p> China's government has made its drive for more sophisticated chips a centerpiece of its strategic plans. </p><p> Last year, after Washington announced new restrictions, Beijing said the government would spend $143 billion to spur China's domestic chip sector. Through a separate program known as \"Thousand Talents,\" the government offers employment, housing, and other incentives for Chinese experts who return from science and tech jobs abroad. </p><p> The program, in existence for more than a decade, has been criticized by Washington because it is viewed by some as a mechanism for China to illegally obtain intellectual property from abroad. </p><p> Last May, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested a California-based software engineer on trade secrets charges. In an FBI affidavit related to the case, investigators said the engineer, Liming Li, had stolen millions of files from two unidentified U.S. employers. </p><p> One of the employers, the affidavit shows, found a folder on Li's laptop containing documents related to \"Thousand Talents.\" The pilfered company files, the FBI alleged, included unspecified materials related to \"national security, nuclear nonproliferation and anti-terrorism.\" </p><p> Li has pleaded not guilty. His attorney, Daniel Olmos, declined to comment. </p><p> Reuters this year has chronicled the race between the West and China for dominance in sectors ranging from killer robots to undersea cables to encryption of digital communications. The struggle for primacy in chipmaking will help determine who triumphs in these technologies and others that will become available once faster processors are developed to enable them. </p><p> \"THE LIMITS OF PHYSICS\" </p><p> Since the 1950s, America's pioneering of chip technology played a major role in the country's creation of the world's largest economy, powerful high-tech and financial sectors, and a thus-far unparalleled military. But China's fast economic growth, and its stated ambition to assert its place as a global power, is now challenging that dominance. </p><p> In the Cold War, Washington blocked exports of some raw materials that Eastern Bloc countries could have used to develop weaponry. At the time, such measures succeeded because countries behind the Iron Curtain were already economically isolated. </p><p> Now, though, globalization has made most industries far more interconnected. Semiconductors, an approximately $600 billion a year business, are no exception. From raw materials to design to assembly, chips are a global industry. </p><p> \"The United States is not going to be able to cut the Chinese off like we did the Soviets,\" said James Andrew Lewis, director of the strategic technologies program at the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies, or CSIS, a Washington think tank. </p><p> An ambition both countries share is self-reliance in the manufacture of advanced microchips. </p><p> Although the United States still leads in many of the technologies needed to design chips, most of the actual printing and assembly happens in Asia. The United States relies heavily on South Korea for memory chips and Taiwan for logic chips. Memory chips store and retrieve information and logic chips process data and execute instructions. </p><p> Last year, the United States approved nearly $53 billion for \"CHIPS for America,\" a program, administered by the Commerce Department, that offers financial incentives to companies that can increase domestic production. Recipients of the incentives are restricted from sharing sensitive technologies with China and other countries not allied with the United States. </p><p> Among the challenges for China to create more advanced chips is access to EDA tools, such as the OPC software touted by SEIDA in early marketing. </p><p> Producing the fastest, most capable chips and circuit boards involves designing and printing them with billions of ever-smaller transistors. To achieve such microscopic connections, EDA helps lay out and verify the design of these circuits and simulate how they'll perform under real-world conditions. </p><p> But EDA tools require intense processing power. </p><p> So specialized is the technology that some advances are marketed as scientific breakthroughs. NVIDIA Corp, the California-based company that is the leading supplier of chips for artificial intelligence, in March said recent advances in OPC technology would help it push the semiconductor industry \"to the limits of physics.\" </p><p> Despite U.S. export controls, China is making advances. </p><p> In 2019, the Commerce Department placed Huawei Technologies Co, the Chinese telecommunications giant, on its list of companies that can't buy U.S. technologies unless the vendor obtains a special license.

Chang said SEIDA has \"a stringent vetting processensuring no infringement upon the intellectual property of others.\"\nExperts in the sector, and people familiar with efforts by Beijing to outmaneuver U.S. curbs on technology transfer, say SEIDA's launch follows a pattern of Chinese companies building upon foreign know-how. Even if the SEIDA executives didn't take property from their previous employer, the technologies involved are so complex that only years of experience with existing purveyors would allow them to offer similar products.\n\"Developing OPC from scratch without access to any existing intellectual property would be challenging in this timeframe, to say the least,\" said Jan-Peter Kleinhans, director of technology and geopolitics at Stiftung Neue Verantwortung, a Berlin think tank where he has researched China's market for EDA tools.\nThe story of SEIDA, which hasn't been previously reported, illustrates the challenges the West faces in thwarting Chinese development of advanced microchip technology. Despite Washington's efforts to slow China's acquisition of chip technology, Beijing is rushing to foster domestic development, attract expert expatriates to come home and overcome its lag in the sector.\nA spokesperson for China's foreign ministry said in a statement that the United States \"abuses export control measures\" and \"applies illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction to Chinese companies.\"\nChina, the spokesperson added, has adopted laws to protect intellectual property and \"complies with internationally accepted rules.\" Technological advances in China, the statement continued, \"are not the result of theft, nor of robbery, but are the result of Chinese people's ingenuity and hard work.\"\nAmerican officials have repeatedly said that Chinese efforts to secure Western technology pose one of the biggest long-term threats to the economy and security of the United States. They have expressed particular concern about China's ability to employ advanced chips, and the powerful processors they enable, for its fast-growing military.\n\"At no point have export controls been more central to our national security,\" Matthew Axelrod, assistant U.S. commerce secretary for export enforcement, said at a Congressional hearing in Washington this month.\nThe Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said such concerns reflect \"a Cold War and hegemonic mentality.\"\nWhile export rules may delay Beijing's progress, industry experts say, they are unlikely to stunt China's development of chip technology. \"The U.S. is lying across the tracks in an effort to stop the Chinese, but it is just going to become a speed bump,\" said Michael Bruck, a former general manager in China for chipmaker Intel Corp. \"It will push China to be more independent.\"\nChina's government has made its drive for more sophisticated chips a centerpiece of its strategic plans.\nLast year, after Washington announced new restrictions, Beijing said the government would spend $143 billion to spur China's domestic chip sector. Through a separate program known as \"Thousand Talents,\" the government offers employment, housing, and other incentives for Chinese experts who return from science and tech jobs abroad.\nThe program, in existence for more than a decade, has been criticized by Washington because it is viewed by some as a mechanism for China to illegally obtain intellectual property from abroad.\nLast May, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested a California-based software engineer on trade secrets charges. In an FBI affidavit related to the case, investigators said the engineer, Liming Li, had stolen millions of files from two unidentified U.S. employers.\nOne of the employers, the affidavit shows, found a folder on Li's laptop containing documents related to \"Thousand Talents.\" The pilfered company files, the FBI alleged, included unspecified materials related to \"national security, nuclear nonproliferation and anti-terrorism.\"\nLi has pleaded not guilty. His attorney, Daniel Olmos, declined to comment.\nReuters this year has chronicled the race between the West and China for dominance in sectors ranging from killer robots to undersea cables to encryption of digital communications. The struggle for primacy in chipmaking will help determine who triumphs in these technologies and others that will become available once faster processors are developed to enable them.\n\"THE LIMITS OF PHYSICS\"\nSince the 1950s, America's pioneering of chip technology played a major role in the country's creation of the world's largest economy, powerful high-tech and financial sectors, and a thus-far unparalleled military. But China's fast economic growth, and its stated ambition to assert its place as a global power, is now challenging that dominance.\nIn the Cold War, Washington blocked exports of some raw materials that Eastern Bloc countries could have used to develop weaponry. At the time, such measures succeeded because countries behind the Iron Curtain were already economically isolated.\nNow, though, globalization has made most industries far more interconnected. Semiconductors, an approximately $600 billion a year business, are no exception. From raw materials to design to assembly, chips are a global industry.\n\"The United States is not going to be able to cut the Chinese off like we did the Soviets,\" said James Andrew Lewis, director of the strategic technologies program at the Center for Strategic & International Studies, or CSIS, a Washington think tank.\nAn ambition both countries share is self-reliance in the manufacture of advanced microchips.\nAlthough the United States still leads in many of the technologies needed to design chips, most of the actual printing and assembly happens in Asia. The United States relies heavily on South Korea for memory chips and Taiwan for logic chips. Memory chips store and retrieve information and logic chips process data and execute instructions.\nLast year, the United States approved nearly $53 billion for \"CHIPS for America,\" a program, administered by the Commerce Department, that offers financial incentives to companies that can increase domestic production. Recipients of the incentives are restricted from sharing sensitive technologies with China and other countries not allied with the United States.\nAmong the challenges for China to create more advanced chips is access to EDA tools, such as the OPC software touted by SEIDA in early marketing.\nProducing the fastest, most capable chips and circuit boards involves designing and printing them with billions of ever-smaller transistors. To achieve such microscopic connections, EDA helps lay out and verify the design of these circuits and simulate how they'll perform under real-world conditions.\nBut EDA tools require intense processing power.\nSo specialized is the technology that some advances are marketed as scientific breakthroughs. NVIDIA Corp, the California-based company that is the leading supplier of chips for artificial intelligence, in March said recent advances in OPC technology would help it push the semiconductor industry \"to the limits of physics.\"\nDespite U.S. export controls, China is making advances.\nIn 2019, the Commerce Department placed Huawei Technologies Co, the Chinese telecommunications giant, on its list of companies that can't buy U.S. technologies unless the vendor obtains a special license. As with SMIC, blacklisted by the department a year later, the U.S. cited national security concerns.\n\"Our export controls on China are designed to massively slow down technology acquisition,\" Thea D. Rozman Kendler, assistant commerce secretary for export administration, said at the recent Congressional hearing.\nStill, Huawei in August introduced a new 5G smartphone with a sophisticated, seven-nanometer chip manufactured by SMIC. The phone, unveiled while U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo was visiting China, was announced to great fanfare. The Commerce Department later said it is investigating whether the two companies relied on restricted U.S. technologies to develop the chip.\nHuawei declined to comment.\nProving the source of some technologies can be challenging.\nMany semiconductor advances build upon existing intellectual property. And the turnover of personnel within the industry, especially across international borders, can make it difficult to investigate export violations or pursue claims of intellectual property theft. \"You can't really control what's in people's brains with any export controls,\" said Lewis of CSIS.\nAlon Raphael, chief executive of a California company that sells a tool to detect semiconductor defects, said he learned that lesson the hard way. Until 2020, he said, FemtoMetrix Inc, was the sole supplier of the technology, which it spent a decade developing.\nBut late that year, Raphael said, Chongji Huang, a key employee, resigned and emerged later in China with a Shanghai-based startup that offers a similar product. \"I had heard these kinds of stories,\" Raphael told Reuters, \"but I said to myself, 'No, not that guy, he's my friend.'\"\nLate last year, FemtoMetrix filed suit in California against the startup. Robert Shwarts, an attorney representing Huang and his startup, Weichong Semiconductor Group, told Reuters that neither Huang nor the startup took anything from FemtoMetrix, nor did they violate any trade secrets.\n\"ENABLE CHIP SUCCESS\"\nSEIDA, the startup managed by Siemens EDA veterans, is one of many Chinese tech startups founded in recent years to meet Beijing's call for a stronger domestic semiconductor industry.\nThe proliferation can be hard to track.\nRecent changes to Chinese regulations restrict access to company registries. Reuters couldn't determine whether China's government had any role in SEIDA's launch or whether Zhang, the chief executive, or his colleagues received any state incentives to leave Siemens EDA and work there.\nReporters reviewed some of SEIDA's corporate filings with the help of two companies that collect and analyze Chinese business records  Datenna, of the Netherlands, and Global Data Risk, based in New York. Combined with interviews and public records, the filings, dating back to October 2021, enabled Reuters to piece together some of SEIDA's history so far.\nSEIDA, the filings show, is majority-owned by partnerships now controlled by Zhang and some of the former Siemens EDA colleagues who joined him. It isn't clear when those partnerships were established or by whom. Records show the partnerships invested in SEIDA in November 2021  weeks after the startup's launch and before Zhang left Siemens EDA.\nZhang's path toward SEIDA began at Mentor Graphics Corp, the predecessor company to Siemens EDA, acquired by Munich-based Siemens in 2017. Mentor, started in Oregon in 1981, was an early innovator of EDA and eventually became one of three U.S. companies that sell most of the software worldwide. By the time of its acquisition, Mentor boasted annual revenues of $1.2 billion.\nWith a masters degree in microelectronics from a Shanghai university, Zhang worked for more than a decade at Mentor and Siemens EDA, according to SEIDA's 2022 presentation to investors. Before joining the startup, he was a Siemens EDA product director.\nZhang is now 44 years old, according to U.S. and Chinese records. He became chief executive of SEIDA in July 2022, according to the SEIDA filings.\nReuters found that at least three other Chinese-born colleagues who joined Zhang were also longtime employees of Siemens EDA. Two of them, Zhitang \"Tim\" Yu and Yun Fei \"Jack\" Deng, earned doctorates from U.S. universities, academic records show. Born in China, Yu is also an American citizen, according to U.S. records. Deng, also born in China, obtained legal permanent resident status in the United States.\nSEIDA declined to make Deng or Yu available for interviews.\nUnder the new export restrictions, U.S. citizens and permanent residents can face penalties if they help Chinese companies develop or manufacture advanced chips without a license. Those penalties can include citations, fines or prison time, depending on the violation.\nChang, the chief operating officer, said by email: \"We continuously monitor both emerging and existing regulations to ensure our operations align with applicable legal standards.\"\nAs they sought investors last year, SEIDA executives aimed high. In the 2022 slideshow, they projected the company could be worth as much as 700 million yuan, or $99 million, by the end of last year. By 2026, they said, SEIDA hoped to sell shares to the public.\nTheir efforts attracted at least one important backer.\nIn June 2023, SEIDA received undisclosed funding from China Fortune-Tech Capital Co, or CFTC, an investment vehicle owned by chipmaker SMIC, according to records compiled by Datenna and PitchBook Data Inc, a U.S.-based corporate research company. CFTC didn't respond to requests for comment.\nSEIDA continues to secure investors. This month, according to its corporate filings, five more investors, including four Chinese venture capital firms, acquired stakes in the company.\nChang wouldn't say if the ongoing review of SEIDA's business plan means a departure from its early marketing of OPC. \"Due to the confidential nature of our business strategies, specific details of our current and future plans cannot be disclosed,\" Chang wrote.\nDuring Reuters' visit to SEIDA headquarters, the reception desk bore the same branding as the early fundraising presentation. The SEIDA name, according to the slideshow, is an acronym for \"Semiconductor Intelligent Design Automation.\" Its slogan, in the branding and on SEIDA's website, translates to \"enable chip success.\"\n(This story has been refiled to remove duplicate dateline)\n(Additional reporting by Engen Tham in Shanghai, David Lague in Hong Kong, and Michael Martina in Washington.

Many of these were projects that were delayed because of COVID-19, and of course there\u2019s a rush to complete them,\u201d he said.\nWhile the official figures are not yet in, Mr Kok said 2023 will close out with construction output of between S$25 billion (US$19 billion) to S$32 billion.\n\u201cThere's a certain sense that perhaps with the expectation (that) there will be rate cuts, the United States\u2019 interest rate may stabilise and there will be a bit more demand,\u201d he explained.\nMr Ang said that in light of diminishing demand and rising financial concerns, most small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) are considering more carefully the ability and resources that they have, especially when it comes to expanding overseas.\n\u201cNaturally, many businesses would be a little more cautious when you talk about new markets and expansion because there is risk involved,\u201d he said.\nHowever, he said that many firms have learnt during the pandemic that with  digitalisation and remote working  , certain parts of the workflow can be relocated overseas.\nMany firms\u2019 strategies moving forward would hence involve identifying possible markets to enter as an offshore opportunity, while keeping and building key manpower and talent in Singapore, said Mr Ang.\nMr Kok urged businesses to tap on the region\u2019s potential and  to continue growing overseas  .\n\u201cFortune favours the bold. I think it's important to send the message to SMEs that even in this climate, they should continue to explore opportunities overseas,\u201d he said.\nHe noted that the survey shows that the percentage of local businesses with an overseas presence has increased from 72 per cent to 76 per cent, with Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia the popular targets.\nMr Kok said that while Singapore is suffering from a demographic deficit, other countries in Southeast Asia are benefiting from a demographic dividend, and the rates of growth in those markets will be much higher.\n\u201cIt's important that our SMEs continue to look for these opportunities, look for partners and pre-position themselves, because dark clouds will go away and when they are ready, they will be better able to exploit these opportunities,\u201d he said.",

                            "text": "Unlock the Editor\u2019s Digest for free\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\nIn the wake of a landmark treaty this year to protect the world\u2019s oceans, countries and financiers are making a renewed effort to protect vulnerable parts of the deep seas.\nThe UN High Seas Treaty, for the conservation of oceans, was finally adopted in June, after years of delay. The treaty covers the two-thirds of the world\u2019s waters that are not within national jurisdictions.\nThere are more than a dozen international organisations that regulate the oceans, but none has comprehensive oversight of the deep seas far from countries\u2019 coastal waters. These waters have been considered \u2018global commons\u2019, but the lack of regulation has left them vulnerable to exploitation. Environmentalists say the treaty is a big step towards protecting biodiversity by controlling human activity in unregulated areas.\n\u201cIt is a major accomplishment that the treaty is completed \u2014 it is clearly a win,\u201d says Liz Karan, director of ocean governance at the Pew Charitable Trusts, a non-profit that campaigns on conservation.\n\nThere are 83 signatories to the agreement, including the EU and countries from Australia to the US. \u201cThis historic high seas treaty creates a co-ordinated approach to establishing marine protected areas on the high seas, a critical step to conserving ocean biodiversity,\u201d said US secretary of state Antony Blinken in September.\nBut countries still need to ratify the treaty to be bound by it. \u201cIt really is just the start,\u201d Karan explains, adding that the next UN ocean conference \u2014 in Nice, France, in June 2025 \u2014 is a good deadline for ratification.\nNot everything has been smooth sailing in ocean governance, though.\nIn March, Michael Lodge, secretary-general of the UN-affiliated International Seabed Authority (ISA),  came under fire  for allegedly steering countries to support certain deep-sea mining projects. The ISA regulates deep-sea mining in international waters. Environmentalists have argued that this activity could cause irreversible damage, in the absence of convincing evidence that it is safe. Companies have yet to seriously start digging underwater, although some countries have an eye on the tax revenues the industry could provide.\nIt is a major accomplishment that the UN treaty is completed. It is clearly a win\nLiz Karan, Pew Charitable Trusts In a March  letter to the ISA  , Germany said it was \u201cseriously concerned\u201d with the authority\u2019s approach.  Lodge responded  , saying the allegations about the ISA\u2019s position on deep-sea mining were \u201cuntrue and I reject such a baseless allegation\u201d. In August, the ISA\u2019s conference closed without resolving deep-sea mining, \u201cdue to different positions among delegations\u201d.\nThe UK government has said it  supports a moratorium  on licences for mining the seabed until there is better evidence about how damaging the work might be. It joined Germany and other countries that have backed a pause in deep-sea mining, to study its environmental consequences.\nHowever, commercialising the oceans has consequences than the solely environmental, says Yoshitaka Ota, director of the Ocean Nexus project at the University of Washington.

                            "text": "WITHIN Asia, it is Chinese activity, not Chinese inactivity, that has people worried, and their concern is understandable. Perhaps most provocative is China\u2019s devotion to the \u201cnine-dash line\u201d, an ill-defined swish of the pen around the South China Sea. Within this perimeter, China claims all the dry land and, it appears, all the water and seabed too; by way of contrast, the rules of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) would tend to see quite a lot of those things as subject to claims from other countries. Speaking in June at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual regional-security shindig in Singapore, Wang Guanzhong, a Chinese general, made it clear that although China respected UNCLOS, the convention could not apply retroactively: the nine-dash line was instituted in the 1940s and the islands of the South China Sea have been Chinese for 2,000 years.\nOthers in China have been blunter. Wu Shicun, head of the National Institute for South China Seas Studies, based on the southern Chinese island of Hainan, recently pointed out that UNCLOS was developed under Western guidance and that, looking to the long term, \u201cwe should rebuild through various methods of regional co-operation a more reasonable, fairer and more just international maritime order that is guided by us.\u201d Not surprisingly, this has caused concern in Washington. \u201cHow much of the temple do they actually want to tear down?\u201d asks Douglas Paal, a former American official now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\nProbably not all that much, for now. But \u201cChina gets it that being a great power is messy, and involves trampling on a few flowers,\u201d says Lyle Goldstein of America\u2019s Naval War College. \u201cIt is a price the Chinese are willing to pay.\u201d Rules such as those which say the nine-dash line must be respected might be acceptable for the small fry. But as China\u2019s then foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, vocally pointed out at a meeting of regional powers in Hanoi in 2010, \u201cChina is a big country and other countries are small countries and that is a fact.\u201d\nMilitarily, this is indeed the case. China\u2019s armed forces are, if not technologically first-rate, certainly large and impressive, not least because they include a nuclear-missile force. But some of Mr Yang\u2019s small countries have a big friend. With troops and bases in Japan and South Korea, America has been the dominant power of the western Pacific for 70 years. Its regional presence has not declined much since it won the cold war a quarter of a century ago. On a trip to Asia in 2011 Barack Obama announced a \u201cpivot\u201d of his country\u2019s policy away from the Middle East and towards Asia.\nChina\u2019s leaders are convinced that America is determined to prevent their country from increasing its strategic and military influence in Asia\u2014that it is trying to contain China as it once sought to contain and eventually crush the Soviet Union. The irony is that China is the only country that really believes the pivot is happening. South-East Asian nations express a fair amount of scepticism at the idea that America\u2019s attention has been newly fixed on their region, and his opponents in America claim Mr Obama has done far too little to follow through on what he said in 2011.\nThat said, the recent Shangri-La Dialogue did nothing to dispel China\u2019s fears. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, offered to assist China\u2019s neighbours with military hardware, and has been pushing, within the constraints of Japan\u2019s pacifist post-war constitution, for a more robust defence policy in the region. In his first year in office Mr Abe visited every member of the Association of South-East Asian Nations. America\u2019s secretary of defence, Chuck Hagel, endorsed Mr Abe\u2019s ideas at Shangri-La, accusing China of \u201cdestabilising unilateral actions\u201d.\nChina has been assertive in the South China Sea for decades, but there has been a distinct hardening of its position since Mr Xi came to power. Recent moves to dominate the seas within the \u201cfirst island chain\u201d that runs from Okinawa through Taiwan to the Spratlys (see map) have alienated almost all the country\u2019s neighbours. \u201cIt would be hard to construct a foreign policy better designed to undermine China\u2019s long-term interests,\u201d argues Brad Glosserman of the Pacific Forum CSIS, a think-tank.\nThe moves are undoubtedly motivated in part by a desire to control the resources of the sea bed. But China itself does not see them as straightforward territorial expansionism. Chinese leaders believe their own rhetoric about the islands of the East and South China Seas having always been part of their territory\u2013a territory that, since the death of Mao, they have chosen to define as almost the empire\u2019s maximum extent under the Qing dynasty, rather than its more modest earlier size. And if they are expressing this territorial interest aggressively, they are behaving no worse\u2014in their eyes, better\u2014than the only other power they see as their match. The Chinese note that America is hardly an unsullied protector of that temple of the global international order; it enjoys the great-power prerogatives and dispensations they seek for their own nation. Disliking the restraints of international treaties perhaps even more than China does, America has not itself ratified UNCLOS. With a handful of allies it rode roughshod over the international legal system to invade Iraq.\n\nVIDEO\nChina might also note parallels between its ambitions and those of America\u2019s in days gone by. Although America waited until the early 20th century to take on a global role, it defined an ambitious regional role a hundred years earlier. In 1823 James Monroe laid out as policy a refusal to countenance any interference in the Western hemisphere by European nations; all incursions would be treated as acts of aggression. Conceptually, what China wants in East Asia seems akin to a Monroe Doctrine: a decrease in the influence of external powers that would allow it untroubled regional dominance. The difference is that the 19th-century Americas did not have any home-grown powers to challenge the United States, and most of its nations were quite content with the idea of keeping European great powers out of the area. At least in its early years, they were the doctrine\u2019s beneficiaries, not its subjects.\nChina is not completely uncompromising. Along its land borders it has let some disputes fade away and offered a bit of give and take. But this is in part because the South and East China Seas are seen as more strategically important. A key part of this strategic importance is the possibility that, eventually, the question of Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty will come to a head; it is in effect protecting its flanks in case of a future clash with America on the matter. The ever-volatile situation in North Korea could also create a flashpoint between the two states.\nWhen Mr Xi said, at his 2013 California summit with Mr Obama, that \u201cthe vast Pacific has enough space for two large countries like the United States and China,\u201d it was an expression not so much of the possibility of peaceful coexistence that must surely come from being separated by 10,000km of water, as of the idea that the western Pacific was a legitimate Chinese sphere of influence.\nAnd if Mr Xi\u2019s words, repeated to America\u2019s secretary of state, John Kerry, in Beijing in July, seemed to imply a symmetry between the countries, China knows that, in fact, it enjoys various asymmetric advantages. For one, it is a unitary actor. It can drive wedges between America and its allies in the region. Hugh White, an Australian academic, argued in a recent article that, by threatening other Asian countries with force, \u201cChina confronts America with the choice between deserting its friends and fighting China.\u201d\nChina\u2019s armed forces are much less proficient than America\u2019s. But China enjoys the advantage of playing at home. America can dominate these seas only through naval and air operations. If Chinese anti-ship missiles present a serious threat to such operations they can greatly reduce America\u2019s ability to project power, without putting China to the expense of developing a navy of its own remotely so capable. Thus the military forces of the two sides are not as unbalanced as one might think by simply counting carrier groups (of which China is building its first, whereas America has ten, four of them in the Pacific).\nChina also thinks there is an asymmetry of will. It sees a war-weary America as unlikely to spend blood and treasure defending uninhabited rocks of no direct strategic importance. America may speak loudly, but its big stick will remain unwielded. China\u2019s people, on the other hand, their views shaped not just by propaganda but also by a nationalism that needs scant encouragement, look on the projection of power in the China seas very favourably. And its military-industrial complex yearns to be paid to build bigger, better sticks of its own. Even if party leaders wanted to succeed in their stated desire for a peaceful rise and to remain within international law, the way they have shaped the spirit of their country would not necessarily let them.\nThis is especially true when it comes to Japan, the country which took on the role of regional power in Asia when China was laid low in the 19th century, and with which relations would always be most vexed. The vitriolic propaganda against the Japanese in Chinese media scarcely needs official prompting; Chinese suffering under Japan\u2019s cruel occupation is well remembered. Japan is a useful whipping boy to distract attention from the party\u2019s inadequacies. China\u2019s leaders have legitimate security concerns and a right to seek a larger international role for their nation but, obsessed with their own narrative of victimhood, they do not see that they themselves are becoming Asia\u2019s bullies.",
                            "html": "<p> WITHIN Asia, it is Chinese activity, not Chinese inactivity, that has people worried, and their concern is understandable. Perhaps most provocative is China\u2019s devotion to the \u201cnine-dash line\u201d, an ill-defined swish of the pen around the South China Sea. Within this perimeter, China claims all the dry land and, it appears, all the water and seabed too; by way of contrast, the rules of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) would tend to see quite a lot of those things as subject to claims from other countries. Speaking in June at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual regional-security shindig in Singapore, Wang Guanzhong, a Chinese general, made it clear that although China respected UNCLOS, the convention could not apply retroactively: the nine-dash line was instituted in the 1940s and the islands of the South China Sea have been Chinese for 2,000 years. </p><figure><img src=\"http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/cf_images/images-magazine/2014/08/23/ES/20140823_ESC426.png\" alt=\"description of the image\"></figure><figure><img src=\"http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/cf_images/images-magazine/2014/08/23/ES/20140823_ESC425.png\" alt=\"description of the image\"></figure><p> Others in China have been blunter. Wu Shicun, head of the National Institute for South China Seas Studies, based on the southern Chinese island of Hainan, recently pointed out that UNCLOS was developed under Western guidance and that, looking to the long term, \u201cwe should rebuild through various methods of regional co-operation a more reasonable, fairer and more just international maritime order that is guided by us.\u201d Not surprisingly, this has caused concern in Washington. \u201cHow much of the temple do they actually want to tear down?\u201d asks Douglas Paal, a former American official now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. </p><p> Probably not all that much, for now. But \u201cChina gets it that being a great power is messy, and involves trampling on a few flowers,\u201d says Lyle Goldstein of America\u2019s Naval War College. \u201cIt is a price the Chinese are willing to pay.\u201d Rules such as those which say the nine-dash line must be respected might be acceptable for the small fry. But as China\u2019s then foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, vocally pointed out at a meeting of regional powers in Hanoi in 2010, \u201cChina is a big country and other countries are small countries and that is a fact.\u201d </p><p> Militarily, this is indeed the case. China\u2019s armed forces are, if not technologically first-rate, certainly large and impressive, not least because they include a nuclear-missile force. But some of Mr Yang\u2019s small countries have a big friend. With troops and bases in Japan and South Korea, America has been the dominant power of the western Pacific for 70 years. Its regional presence has not declined much since it won the cold war a quarter of a century ago. On a trip to Asia in 2011 Barack Obama announced a \u201cpivot\u201d of his country\u2019s policy away from the Middle East and towards Asia. </p><p> China\u2019s leaders are convinced that America is determined to prevent their country from increasing its strategic and military influence in Asia\u2014that it is trying to contain China as it once sought to contain and eventually crush the Soviet Union. The irony is that China is the only country that really believes the pivot is happening. South-East Asian nations express a fair amount of scepticism at the idea that America\u2019s attention has been newly fixed on their region, and his opponents in America claim Mr Obama has done far too little to follow through on what he said in 2011. </p><p> That said, the recent Shangri-La Dialogue did nothing to dispel China\u2019s fears. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, offered to assist China\u2019s neighbours with military hardware, and has been pushing, within the constraints of Japan\u2019s pacifist post-war constitution, for a more robust defence policy in the region. In his first year in office Mr Abe visited every member of the Association of South-East Asian Nations. America\u2019s secretary of defence, Chuck Hagel, endorsed Mr Abe\u2019s ideas at Shangri-La, accusing China of \u201cdestabilising unilateral actions\u201d. </p><p> China has been assertive in the South China Sea for decades, but there has been a distinct hardening of its position since Mr Xi came to power. Recent moves to dominate the seas within the \u201cfirst island chain\u201d that runs from Okinawa through Taiwan to the Spratlys (see map) have alienated almost all the country\u2019s neighbours. \u201cIt would be hard to construct a foreign policy better designed to undermine China\u2019s long-term interests,\u201d argues Brad Glosserman of the Pacific Forum CSIS, a think-tank. </p><p> The moves are undoubtedly motivated in part by a desire to control the resources of the sea bed. But China itself does not see them as straightforward territorial expansionism. Chinese leaders believe their own rhetoric about the islands of the East and South China Seas having always been part of their territory\u2013a territory that, since the death of Mao, they have chosen to define as almost the empire\u2019s maximum extent under the Qing dynasty, rather than its more modest earlier size. And if they are expressing this territorial interest aggressively, they are behaving no worse\u2014in their eyes, better\u2014than the only other power they see as their match. The Chinese note that America is hardly an unsullied protector of that temple of the global international order; it enjoys the great-power prerogatives and dispensations they seek for their own nation. Disliking the restraints of international treaties perhaps even more than China does, America has not itself ratified UNCLOS. With a handful of allies it rode roughshod over the international legal system to invade Iraq. </p><h4> Video </h4><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/\" alt=\"\"></figure><p> China might also note parallels between its ambitions and those of America\u2019s in days gone by. Although America waited until the early 20th century to take on a global role, it defined an ambitious regional role a hundred years earlier. In 1823 James Monroe laid out as policy a refusal to countenance any interference in the Western hemisphere by European nations; all incursions would be treated as acts of aggression. Conceptually, what China wants in East Asia seems akin to a Monroe Doctrine: a decrease in the influence of external powers that would allow it untroubled regional dominance. The difference is that the 19th-century Americas did not have any home-grown powers to challenge the United States, and most of its nations were quite content with the idea of keeping European great powers out of the area. At least in its early years, they were the doctrine\u2019s beneficiaries, not its subjects. </p><p> China is not completely uncompromising. Along its land borders it has let some disputes fade away and offered a bit of give and take. But this is in part because the South and East China Seas are seen as more strategically important. A key part of this strategic importance is the possibility that, eventually, the question of Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty will come to a head; it is in effect protecting its flanks in case of a future clash with America on the matter.

The bank provided financing upfront in return for an agreed number of Australian carbon credit units, to be delivered over five years.\nThe lawyers helped to navigate regulations and provide risk mitigation, which can be complex for agricultural projects designed to deliver future carbon reduction benefits.\nShearman & Sterling\nO: 8; L: 7; I: 8; Total: 23\nThe firm advised the International Finance Corporation, the private sector arm of the World Bank, on its first bond investment in Bangladesh. A bond investment enables the IFC to provide funding in local currency. The lawyers designed a special agreement with the key elements of an IFC loan \u2014 such as environmental, social and governance (ESG) requirements \u2014 to go alongside its subscription to the bond offering issued by Bangladesh\u2019s Brac Bank.\n\nCOMMENDED\nHogan Lovells\nO: 6; L: 8; I: 7; Total: 21\nThe lawyers helped the IFC with two bond issuances in the Philippines, one in the healthcare sector and one financing renewable energy for the hospitality sector. Injecting capital into the Philippines market in this way can help to overcome scepticism in the region around bonds linked to the UN sustainable development goals, by proving that they are able to generate value.\nKim & Chang\nO: 7; L: 7; I: 6; Total: 20\nWhen a South Korean manufacturing group required all its companies to consolidate their approach to ESG reporting, the law firm created a multidisciplinary team to negotiate between the large number of stakeholders to agree a common framework.\nShardul Amarchand Mangaldas\nO: 7; L: 6; I: 6; Total: 19\nIn advising on the first issuance of a \u201cgreen\u201d bond by a real estate investment trust in India, the firm drew on international standards to design a framework, including a reporting and disclosure process, for the financing of \u201cgreen\u201d buildings, covering questions such as their use of water and energy.\nNishimura & Asahi\nO: 5; L: 7; I: 7; Total: 19\nTo advise on project financing for an offshore wind power project near Hokkaido in northern Japan, the lawyers had to reach agreements with financial institutions across the globe. As it was the first of its kind in Japan to include financing for battery storage, and because of its offshore location, the project required a novel security arrangement, involving the value of physical assets used and of the project in the future.\n\nDIGITAL ASSETS\nWinner  :  Allen & Overy\nOriginality: 8; Leadership: 9; Impact: 9; Total: 26\nThe firm advised the Hong Kong government on its first bond issuance via blockchain token, which uses Hong Kong dollar cash tokens, Hong Kong\u2019s centrally issued cryptocurrency. The lawyers led the creation of the bond and automated the administrative processes on Goldman Sachs\u2019s digital asset tokenisation platform. Using a blockchain platform for bond issuance makes payment settlement faster, speeding up secondary trading.\n\nSTANDOUT\nYulchon\nO: 8; L: 8; I 9; Total: 25\nAn alliance of South Korea\u2019s five biggest cryptocurrency exchanges all delisted crypto coin wemix in November 2022 in order to protect consumers. When the coin\u2019s issuer, video game company Wemade, challenged the action as anti-competitive, Yulchon successfully argued in court that Wemade had issued misleading disclosures about the coin and that the exchanges, one of which was a client, took independent decisions to delist. This sets a precedent for self-regulation by crypto exchanges in South Korea.\nAnand and Anand\nO: 8; L: 8; I: 8; Total: 24\nIndian conglomerate Tata Sons asked the law firm to assist when London-based business Hakunamatata began selling cryptocurrency with the name \u201cTata coin\u201d. Pursuing this case in London would have been hard because of the time and on-the-ground resources needed. The lawyers successfully argued that an Indian court had jurisdiction and that the coin constituted an infringement of the Tata trademark because Hakunamatata\u2019s website had a demonstrable online presence for consumers in New Delhi. This has been used as a precedent for similar disputes over digital assets.\nDechert\nO: 8; L: 7; I: 8; Total: 23\nThe firm helped asset manager Fore Elite Capital Management set up and launch a fund in Hong Kong in February 2022 that invests solely in virtual assets. It had to convince the regulator by establishing safeguards, such as a process to ensure only authorised individuals could make trades in crypto coins and derivatives.\n\nCOMMENDED\nBaker McKenzie\nO: 8; L: 7; I: 7; Total: 22\nLed by partner Kammalard U-rapeepatanapong, the firm\u2019s Thailand office has done pioneering work on digital assets in the region.

It also advised on regulatory frameworks for initial coin offerings and security token offerings.\nMorgan Lewis & Bockius\nO: 8; L: 7; I: 7; Total: 22\nThe firm helped digital asset exchange Zipmex develop a restructuring plan, which was approved by the Singapore courts in March. The lawyers needed to establish a centre of main influence for the company, which was decentralised, before going ahead with the restructuring. They argued this should be Singapore as the business\u2019s most relevant market, although its operations were based in other countries, and also co-ordinated a large number of stakeholders including 400,000 or so creditors.\nRajah & Tann\nO: 7; L: 6; I: 7; Total: 20\nIn a case of cryptocurrency stolen from a US citizen in Mexico, the individual\u2019s US counsel approached Rajah & Tann, due to the firm\u2019s expertise in the Singapore legal market. The firm successfully argued to the Singaporean courts that the cryptocurrency amounted to property subject to trust and that, as the coins passed through crypto exchanges based in Singapore, the courts could freeze the assets.\nClifford Chance\nO: 6; L: 6; I: 7; Total: 19\nZodia Custody, a UK-based crypto asset custodian launched by Standard Chartered bank in association with Northern Trust, approached the firm for advice on a joint venture with Japanese financial conglomerate SBI Group to launch a crypto asset custodian in Japan. The lawyers managed complex legal questions around intellectual property and share price structure.\nYulchon\nO: 6; L: 7; I: 6; Total: 19\nWhen Japanese messenger app Line decided to launch a platform for consumers to trade non-fungible tokens, Yulchon\u2019s digital asset specialists advised on all legal aspects relating to the issuance, marketing and commerce of the tokens. The lawyers helped design a membership model and system for payments and foreign exchange transactions.\n\nTRANSFORMING INDUSTRIES\nWinner: Clifford Chance\nOriginality: 8; Leadership: 8; Impact: 9; Total: 25\nThe firm provided legal support for a joint venture set up between financial services firms DBS Bank, JPMorgan and Temasek, that was supported by the regulator, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, to create Partior: a platform that simplifies and speeds up interbank payment settlements, using blockchain.\nThe firm managed negotiations with shareholders and drafted an original set of documents that defined the rules of the network and the regulatory constraints of participants.\n\nSTANDOUT\nSimmons & Simmons\nO: 8; L: 8; I: 8; Total: 24\nThe firm partnered with UBS\u2019s wealth management team on the launch of Circle One \u2014 a mobile banking app for the bank\u2019s high-net-worth clients. It provides them with access to financial advisers and market information through curated articles and podcasts.\nThe firm advised on product design and compliance with Hong Kong and Singaporean banking regulations.\nDLA Piper\nO: 8; L: 8; I: 7; Total: 23\nThe firm has created a dedicated team of more than 100 lawyers and professionals from across DLA Piper to cover health tech \u2014 combining intellectual property, regulatory, data privacy, contracting, logistics and life sciences resources. The team offers a global perspective on telehealth, which is the use of technology to access healthcare and related digital health products.\n\nCOMMENDED\nNishimura & Asahi\nO: 7; L: 8; I: 7; Total: 22\nThe agri-food practice group at the law firm advises the Japanese Cabinet Office and the ministry of agriculture, forestry and fisheries on legal practice in sustainability.

                            "text": "That is why he thinks the fishing community \u201cmight be more inclined\u201d toward the Kuomintang (KMT) in Taiwan\u2019s Jan 13 presidential election, since the opposition party \u201ccommunicates better with mainland China\u201d.\n\nThe second commitment is to ensure that Taiwan and China \u201caren\u2019t subordinate to each other\u201d. The third commitment is to \u201cresist encroachments on our sovereignty, or annexation\u201d.\n\nTPP secretary-general Chou Tai-chu, meanwhile, tells Insight his party \u201ccan\u2019t just look plainly at the relationship between Taiwan and China \u2014 we also need to look at global relations\u201d.\n\u201cCaught in the middle, we need to also consider America\u2019s feelings when we\u2019re handling the cross-strait relations,\u201d he says. \u201cAs the US-China relationship evolves, Taiwan needs to find a balance in between.\u201d\nBut this balance could become increasingly difficult to maintain, as Beijing still considers Taiwan a renegade province, and Chinese President Xi Jinping has not ruled out the use of force in pursuit of reunification.\nIt has always been a difficult balancing act, \u201cregardless of who\u2019s in power in Taiwan\u201d, says J Michael Cole, a Taipei-based senior adviser on countering foreign authoritarian influence at the International Republican Institute.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had the administrations that leaned closer towards China, and that was also difficult for them because ultimately, the only guarantor of Taiwan\u2019s security is the US.\u201d\n\nFrom the DPP\u2019s perspective, the US is \u201cvery important for Taiwan\u201d, says Chao. \u201cOur job is to \u2026 ensure that we have clear lines of communication with the US. We have a high degree of mutual trust (and) respect.\u201d\n\nIn terms of interests, we share a common interest in ensuring stability and peace here in the Taiwan Strait.\u201d\n\nThe 64-year-old communications professor at the National Chengchi University (NCCU) is a member of a group of retired and active academics who advocate for Taiwan\u2019s autonomy while maintaining an equal distance from China and the US.\n\u201cTaiwan\u2019s been strengthening its military and purchasing a lot of military equipment,\u201d he notes. \u201cThis increases the hostility of cross-strait relations. We feel that this isn\u2019t a good thing for Taiwan (and) for both sides and the world.\n\u201cThe US is using Ukraine to weaken Russia \u2014 this is what Defence Secretary (Lloyd) Austin has said himself. If the US has such plans, we\u2019ll be worried if they use Taiwan to weaken Beijing. \u2026 Why should we be your proxy?\u201d\nMost Taiwanese, however, view the US more positively than China \u2014 by a margin of nearly two to one, the Pew Research Centre found in 2020. Younger Taiwanese are especially likely to favour closer ties with Washington over Beijing.\nWATCH: How do the Taiwanese view America? The US factor in Taiwan\u2019s 2024 elections (6:35)\n\n\u201cThis is because Ko is rather straightforward,\u201d says Wang. \u201cHe\u2019s very different from other political personalities, \u2026 from the usual stereotypes of a political personality.\n\u201cThe main point is that many youngsters admire Ko\u2019s style of doing things and personal charisma.\u201d\nFor many voters too, it is domestic issues that weigh on their minds, especially with Taiwan\u2019s sluggish economy. They are faced with an increase in the cost of living, for example.\nWhile inflation in Taiwan is by global standards relatively low, the 2.95 per cent hike in prices in 2022 was the highest on the island since 2008. More recently, prices rose 3.05 per cent in October, a 15-month high.\n\u201cThe government tried to manage \u2026 the price (of) public utilities (as) most of the public utility companies are state-owned,\u201d notes Kristy Hsu, the director of the Taiwan Asean Studies Centre at the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve frozen, for example, the electricity price, gasoline price, and \u2026 that helped stabilise the prices.\u201d\n\nHousing, however, remains expensive. According to the government\u2019s rent index in June, rents in Taiwan were the highest since records began in 1981.\nDriven up in part by speculators, high property prices coupled with low wages are pricing young voters out of homes of their own.\nTake, for example, fresh graduate Tim Huang from Taichung city, who just found a job in Taipei. \u201cFood and rental costs here are high,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen your income isn\u2019t so high, you only manage to save a little.\n\u201cUnder such circumstances, it might not be quite possible to buy a property in Taipei city even after 10 or 20 years.\u201d\nThe presidential candidates have put forth plans to raise wages and control prices. The DPP\u2019s Chao cites several initiatives Lai launched previously, such as regulatory changes for start-ups, including relaxing some financial restrictions and building regulatory sandboxes.\n\nSecond, workforce housing: All enterprises with land are encouraged to build workforce housing. Third, helping the disadvantaged (through) tax reduction.\u201d\n\nIn facing its economic challenges, however, Taiwan cannot escape the turbulence of global power rivalry. The recent ban on the island's agricultural and fishery products illustrates how China has flexed its economic muscle.\n\nWhen our products are competitive, even if we don\u2019t sell our products over there, we can still sell (them) to other regions.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we need \u2026 trade incentives. And this is why the Tsai administration, over the past eight years, has had a robust focus on bridging new trade deals with important trading partners.\u201d",

                            "text": "SINGAPORE: The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored how \u201cclosely intertwined\u201d countries and people have become, Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean said on Tuesday (Feb 23).\nIn an address at the Middle East Institute\u2019s (MEI) annual conference, Mr Teo said it has become even more imperative that countries \u201crethink, refresh and revitalise our traditional relationships\u201d and build more diverse and wider networks.\nCountries should also explore new areas for cooperation in technology, the digital economy and people-to-people ties, added Mr Teo, who is also Coordinating Minister for National Security.\n\u201cAsia, including both the Indo-Pacific and the Middle East, is responding to a changing world. The centre of gravity of the world is shifting from the Atlantic to the Pacific and Indian Oceans, in particular in the economic arena,\u201d said the Senior Minister.\n\u201cThis includes energy and trade flows, and increasingly in two-way trade and investment, capital flows and technology. Many economies in this vast region have been growing much faster than their counterparts in North America and Western Europe, pulling the centre of global economic activity steadily eastwards.\u201d\nBoth regions are responding to new domestic imperatives, and are undergoing \u201csignificant demographic changes\u201d, he said.\nBeyond facing similar external and internal circumstances, both the Indo-Pacific region and the Middle East have \u201cunique characteristics\u201d that make engagement and exchanges interesting and fruitful, he added.\nThe Senior Minister highlighted three key areas: Economic partnerships, religious exchanges and people-to-people interactions.\n\u201cTrade between our regions is growing and becoming more diverse,\u201d said Mr Teo.\nSingapore was the first country from outside the region to sign a free trade agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), he noted.\nThe GCC-Singapore FTA, which came into force in 2013, has helped to bolster economic ties over the years and laid the foundations to diversify Singapore\u2019s trade with the GCC, he added.\n\u201cWhen traditional supply chains were disrupted by COVID-19 last year, Singapore looked to the Middle East to diversify our supply chains and safeguard our food supply, such as by importing prawns from Saudi Arabia \u2013 something not so traditional, but a useful source for us nevertheless,\u201d Mr Teo explained.\nNew partnerships are forming in sectors such as technology, sustainability and info-communications development.\n\u201cBoth sides can work with each other to accelerate their modernisation and diversification efforts,\u201d said Mr Teo.\nThrough globalisation, societies around the world have become increasingly multicultural and diverse, he noted.\nThe Middle East has \u201cinspired and influenced the religious beliefs, values and practices of many faiths\u201d, said Mr Teo.\n\u201cThe major world religions of Islam, Christianity and Judaism trace their origins there. In particular, the Middle East holds special significance as the origin of Islam and the seat of its holiest sites,\u201d he said.\n\u201cMuslims in the Middle East and North Africa constitute only 20 per cent of the world\u2019s Muslim population. Here in the Indo-Pacific, we collectively have the largest number of Muslims anywhere in the world, at 62 per cent,\u201d he added.\n\u201cThe top four countries with the largest Muslim populations in the world, as of 2015, are all in the Indo-Pacific \u2013 Indonesia with 12.6 per cent, India with 11.1 per cent, Pakistan with 10.5 per cent and Bangladesh with 8.2 per cent.\n\u201cAs the seat of Islam, how the Middle East understands the religion, and Islam\u2019s relationships with other faiths, will shape the practice of Islam all over the world, including in Asia.\u201d\nHe said that many aspiring Islamic religious teachers from the Indo-Pacific region, including Singapore, study in the Middle East and North Africa.\nIn Singapore, secondary school students have been able to learn Arabic as a third language since 2008.\n\u201cThe learning of Arabic will bolster our people-to-people ties and promote a better understanding of the Arab world and Islam,\u201d said Mr Teo.\n\u201cIn fact, this has taken on greater importance today. Islam has unfortunately been misinterpreted and misused in some quarters.\n\u201cThe Indo-Pacific can work together with the Middle East to stand firm against violence and terrorism, and promote more tolerance, moderation and accommodation among all religions. We should also work together to promote a better understanding of Islam, in particular its fundamental beliefs and values, around the world.\u201d\nWhile the Indo-Pacific and Middle East have their own cultural characteristics, there are also many similarities, noted Mr Teo.\n\u201cThis has provided the impetus for regular engagement. For example, Korea and Japan are not only major investors in the Middle East over the past few decades; they have also had significant historical cultural and commercial exchanges,\u201d he added.\nChina established relations with the Middle East in the 7th century, during the Tang Dynasty, and is now re-engaging the region through different ways, including the Silk Road Economic Belt of its Belt and Road Initiative.\n\u201cIndia, given its proximity, shares deep civilizational roots, cultural exchanges and historical linkages with the Middle East,\u201d said the Senior Minister.\n\u201cSoutheast Asia too has a long relationship with the Middle East.\u201d\nThe discovery of a shipwreck \u2013 a dhow laden with Chinese porcelain decorated with Islamic motifs - off the coast of Belitung Island, Indonesia in 1998 shows the people-to-people exchanges that connected civilisations along the Maritime Silk Road more than 1,200 years ago.\nIt confirmed that overland routes were not the only trade connections between the East and the West, and that Southeast Asia lay at the heart of a global maritime trading network.\n\u201cMuslim traders brought Islam from the heartlands of the Arab peninsula to Southeast Asia. Some Arab traders sank their roots in Southeast Asia, of which the Hadramis from Yemen were the most prominent,\u201d said Mr Teo.\n\u201cThe Aljunieds, the Alkaffs and the Alsagoffs are among the well known Arab families in Singapore.\u201d\nHe said that the regions shared a \u201cmore recent history\u201d.\n\u201cMany of the countries in the Gulf became independent from European powers at about the same time as those in the Indo-Pacific, from the late 1940s to the 1960s. This shared historical context and political experience bind us together,\u201d he added.",

Here in the Indo-Pacific, we collectively have the largest number of Muslims anywhere in the world, at 62 per cent,\u201d he added. </p><p> \u201cThe top four countries with the largest Muslim populations in the world, as of 2015, are all in the Indo-Pacific \u2013 Indonesia with 12.6 per cent, India with 11.1 per cent, Pakistan with 10.5 per cent and Bangladesh with 8.2 per cent. </p><p> \u201cAs the seat of Islam, how the Middle East understands the religion, and Islam\u2019s relationships with other faiths, will shape the practice of Islam all over the world, including in Asia.\u201d </p><p> He said that many aspiring Islamic religious teachers from the Indo-Pacific region, including Singapore, study in the Middle East and North Africa. </p><p> In Singapore, secondary school students have been able to learn Arabic as a third language since 2008. </p><p> \u201cThe learning of Arabic will bolster our people-to-people ties and promote a better understanding of the Arab world and Islam,\u201d said Mr Teo. </p><p> \u201cIn fact, this has taken on greater importance today. Islam has unfortunately been misinterpreted and misused in some quarters. </p><p> \u201cThe Indo-Pacific can work together with the Middle East to stand firm against violence and terrorism, and promote more tolerance, moderation and accommodation among all religions. We should also work together to promote a better understanding of Islam, in particular its fundamental beliefs and values, around the world.\u201d </p><p> While the Indo-Pacific and Middle East have their own cultural characteristics, there are also many similarities, noted Mr Teo. </p><p> \u201cThis has provided the impetus for regular engagement. For example, Korea and Japan are not only major investors in the Middle East over the past few decades; they have also had significant historical cultural and commercial exchanges,\u201d he added. </p><p> China established relations with the Middle East in the 7th century, during the Tang Dynasty, and is now re-engaging the region through different ways, including the Silk Road Economic Belt of its Belt and Road Initiative. </p><p> \u201cIndia, given its proximity, shares deep civilizational roots, cultural exchanges and historical linkages with the Middle East,\u201d said the Senior Minister. </p><p> \u201cSoutheast Asia too has a long relationship with the Middle East.\u201d </p><p> The discovery of a shipwreck \u2013 a dhow laden with Chinese porcelain decorated with Islamic motifs - off the coast of Belitung Island, Indonesia in 1998 shows the people-to-people exchanges that connected civilisations along the Maritime Silk Road more than 1,200 years ago. </p><p> It confirmed that overland routes were not the only trade connections between the East and the West, and that Southeast Asia lay at the heart of a global maritime trading network. </p><p> \u201cMuslim traders brought Islam from the heartlands of the Arab peninsula to Southeast Asia. Some Arab traders sank their roots in Southeast Asia, of which the Hadramis from Yemen were the most prominent,\u201d said Mr Teo. </p><p> \u201cThe Aljunieds, the Alkaffs and the Alsagoffs are among the well known Arab families in Singapore.\u201d </p><p> He said that the regions shared a \u201cmore recent history\u201d. </p><p> \u201cMany of the countries in the Gulf became independent from European powers at about the same time as those in the Indo-Pacific, from the late 1940s to the 1960s. This shared historical context and political experience bind us together,\u201d he added. </p>",

Their rivalry has other serious implications.\nObservers should be wary of Washington\u2019s embrace of industrial policy, or government efforts to support strategic industries by eschewing free market policies for interventionism. Even as the Inflation Reduction Act pumps over US$369 billion into the US clean energy sector, other countries might launch their own industrial policies with an arsenal of subsidies to remain competitive.\nIn a worst-case scenario, FDI might be drawn away from the region and towards markets with better subsidies.\n\nGlobal demand for these minerals is expected to surge by 400 per cent to 600 per cent in the next several decades. Any shortage would have knock-on effects on the price of these fixtures, making green transitions more expensive.\n\nA case in point is the 2022 US Commerce Department investigation into eight solar panel companies in Southeast Asia (Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia) accused of skirting US tariffs on Chinese-sourced materials.\nThat the US is heavily reliant on these four countries for photovoltaic panels \u2013 accounting for about 75 per cent on imports in 2021 \u2013 was not enough to defend against bipartisan determination to crack down on \u201cunfair\u201d Chinese trade practices.\nNot only did the Commerce Department find the exporters guilty of skirting tariffs, but the US Congress voted to reinstate tariffs of up to 254 per cent on solar panels from Southeast Asia.

It discusses the foreign direct investment (FDI) trends in Southeast Asia, particularly with the relocation of investments from China due to growing US-China tensions. It also mentions the US and Chinese investment policies and their implications for the region. Additionally, it touches upon the US Commerce Department's investigation into solar panel companies in Southeast Asia, which is related to investment policies and FDI trends. Therefore, this article is relevant to the user's query.\n\nY",
                    "relevant content": "INVESTMENTS ARE RISING, BUT SO ARE COSTS\nFirst, the good news. By positioning themselves as neutral parties with growing middle classes and lower labour costs, Southeast Asian economies have disproportionately benefitted as companies relocate their China investments amid growing US-China tensions. The region attracted a record US$222.5 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2022 in a post-pandemic bump.\nThis trend continued in 2023, with the US unveiling billions of dollars in investments into Vietnam shortly after upgrading their ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership, including a US$1.6 billion chip factory by Amkor.\nChina, meanwhile, invested heavily in Southeast Asia's electric vehicle (EV) sector. Carmaker BYD is building a plant in Thailand and Geely announced a US$10 billion investment to develop  Malaysia's Automotive High-Tech Valley in Perak  .\nIf only US-China competition was all about who could invest the most into the region. Their rivalry has other serious implications.\nObservers should be wary of Washington's embrace of industrial policy, or government efforts to support strategic industries by eschewing free market policies for interventionism. Even as the Inflation Reduction Act pumps over US$369 billion into the US clean energy sector, other countries might launch their own industrial policies with an arsenal of subsidies to remain competitive.\nIn a worst-case scenario, FDI might be drawn away from the region and towards markets with better subsidies.\n\nGlobal demand for these minerals is expected to surge by 400 per cent to 600 per cent in the next several decades. Any shortage would have knock-on effects on the price of these fixtures, making green transitions more expensive.\n\nA case in point is the 2022 US Commerce Department investigation into eight solar panel companies in Southeast Asia (Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia) accused of skirting US tariffs on Chinese-sourced materials.\nThat the US is heavily reliant on these four countries for photovoltaic panels  accounting for about 75 per cent on imports in 2021  was not enough to defend against bipartisan determination to crack down on \"unfair\" Chinese trade practices.\nNot only did the Commerce Department find the exporters guilty of skirting tariffs, but the US Congress voted to reinstate tariffs of up to 254 per cent on solar panels from Southeast Asia. President Joe Biden vetoed this legislative bid, but his waiver on retroactive tariffs only extends until June 2024.\nIn effect, Southeast Asian firms are caught between a rock and a hard place. They might be forced to choose between Chinese expertise and the lucrative US market, limiting their ability to grow and support their home country's green transition.\n\nNAVIGATING ROUGH WATERS, WITH HELP\nThe costs of a failed green transition are especially stark for Southeast Asia. One model by Deloitte predicted that the region could lose US$28 trillion over the next 50 years in losses from tourism, services and manufacturing if its carbon emissions are not addressed.\nWhile these challenges are steep, they are not insurmountable. There is still room to leverage the competition between the two superpowers to support the region's green transition.\n\nKevin Chen is an Associate Research Fellow with the US Programme at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore."

The number of people who suffer from drug addiction has jumped by 45%, to nearly 40m, over the same period. </p><p> Most of the growth in drug use is probably explained by wider consumption of cannabis and opioids evident in the <small> UNODC\u2019 </small> s data, the latter of which is fuelling a devastating 20-year epidemic in North America. The more striking bits of the report concern two connected trends: the increasingly global nature of drug-trafficking networks, and the rise of synthetic drugs. </p>",

It\u2019s really habitual now and I still need to remind myself I don\u2019t need to wear it in most settings,\u201d she said.\nBeyond mask-wearing and heightened awareness of hygiene among some, Singapore\u2019s healthcare system has also seen major changes that are here to stay, such as the growing prevalence of telehealth.\nAs of Nov 14, there are 178 clinics offering consultations, antigen rapid testing or both through video conferencing in Singapore, according to the Ministry of Health's (MOH) website.\nWhile using video conferencing tools for medical consultations had been piloted prior to the pandemic, Integrated Health Information Systems (IHiS) assistant chief executive Alan Goh said the crisis served as \u201can impetus with accelerated adoption by both patients and providers\u201d.\nSuch services \u201cenabled a lean medical team to care for a large number of COVID-19 patients, while other healthcare workers could focus on providing care to patients with more urgent care needs in the acute hospitals\u201d despite stretched medical resources.\n\u201cAs Singapore transits into the COVID-19 endemic stage, we envisage that telehealth will continue to be a mainstay feature in Singapore\u2019s healthcare landscape offering greater convenience, improved accessibility to care, as well as time and cost savings for both providers and patients,\u201d said Mr Goh.\nPrior to COVID-19, IHiS \u2014 which is MOH\u2019s IT arm \u2014 had about 1,900 public healthcare patients using video consultations. The cumulative number jumped to more than 34,000 in 2020 and more than 120,000 in 2021.\nThe figure has continued to rise: By 2022, about 170,000 patients had sought their doctors online.\n\u201cWe see this as an opportunity to leverage the current momentum where there is now greater comfort and familiarity among residents in using digital solutions as part of their lived experience,\u201d said Mr Goh.\n\u201cThe core technology and care concepts will form the backbone behind expanded uses in areas such as virtual wards at home, and involvement of the community and social care sectors in supporting better health outcomes for our population.\u201d\n\n-\n\nE-COMMERCE\n\nWhile the 11.11 sales for these e-commerce platforms were much higher than a typical day, they did not disclose the total sales achieved \u2014 unlike in previous years.\n\n1\n-\n\nE-PAYMENTS\n\nEXPERTS ON WHY BEHAVIOURIAL CHANGES STICK AND OTHERS DON'T\nGiven the magnitude of COVID-19's devastation, affecting millions of lives and livelihoods around the world, it is inevitable that the pandemic caused some behavioural changes among people, experts told TODAY.\nAnd the reason why some behavioural changes have persisted, even as people learn to live with the virus, is because the benefits of adopting such changes outweigh the costs, said NUS sociologist Tan Ern Ser.\nFor example, technology has an increased presence in people\u2019s lives when it comes to shopping and work, among other things, because of its convenience, user-friendliness and time and cost savings.\nHowever, Dr Tan noted that human interaction and activities, such as verbal and non-verbal communication, cannot be fully facilitated by digital means.\n\u201cThe positive aspects of digital use remain, when necessary, but people return to a 'new normal' which allows for multidimensional human interactions, together with the use of digital means,\u201d he said.\nDr Ong from Research For Impact said that at an individual level, there may not be a clear way to predict why some behaviours shift back to a pre-pandemic mode quicker than others.\n\u201cIndividuals\u2019 own willingness to take risk, their subjective risk perceptions and the tangible or intangible costs and benefits inherent to personal circumstances all shape behaviours,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAll else equal, certain people may be more willing to take certain risks and go back to their pre-pandemic behaviours more quickly than others.\u201d\nMs Gianna Gayle Amul, senior policy researcher and director of communications at Research For Impact, reiterated that government policies played a large role in shaping behaviours during the pandemic.\n\u201cAt a more macro level, reversions in some behaviours can also be partly attributed to government policy, for instance, incentives that push for the return of tourism globally and rebooting the economy, not just locally but also globally,\u201d she said.\nWith most people in Singapore being up to date with their vaccinations or having had a COVID-19 infection at least once, there is also a degree of confidence that they would be safe from severe infection.\n\u201cAs a global city-state, Singapore cannot afford to remain closed and be left behind when the rest of the world has decided to \u2018move on\u2019 from the ongoing pandemic,\" said Ms Amul.\nThis story was originally published in  TODAY  .",
