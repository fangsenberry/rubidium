A research team at the HKUST Business School has developed InvestLM \u2014 Hong Kong\u2019s first open-source large language model (LLM) for GenAI applications, capable of generating investment-related, human-like responses comparable to those of well-known commercial chatbots, including OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. InvestLM\u2019s model parameters and the insights from its development process have been made publicly available to support industry practitioners and researchers in deploying LLM-related technology.\nThe emergence of open-source LLMs has opened a new avenue for exploring the potential of GenAI, allowing those with moderate computing resources to train LLMs for their own needs. By adapting from LLaMA-65B, an open-source general-purpose LLM developed by Meta, with a high-quality and diverse set of finance and investment- related texts using a technique called instruction fine-tuning, the HKUST research team has developed InvestLM, a state-of-the-art LLM for the financial domain. InvestLM\u2019s responses have been rated as comparable to those of state-of-the-art commercial LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Claude-2, by financial experts, such as hedge fund managers and research analysts. According to the research team, with its strong capabilities in understanding financial texts, InvestLM can potentially enhance the work efficiency of finance and investment professionals in tasks such as providing investment insights, extracting information from and summarizing financial news and reports.\nProfessor TAM Kan-Yan, Dean of HKUST Business School, said, \u201cDeveloping LLMs in-house can help financial firms gain competitive edge through the application of generative AI, while retaining better control over proprietary information and customers\u2019 data.

A research team at the HKUST Business School has developed InvestLM \u2014 Hong Kong\u2019s first open-source large language model (LLM) for GenAI applications, capable of generating investment-related, human-like responses comparable to those of well-known commercial chatbots, including OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. InvestLM\u2019s model parameters and the insights from its development process have been made publicly available to support industry practitioners and researchers in deploying LLM-related technology. </p><p> The emergence of open-source LLMs has opened a new avenue for exploring the potential of GenAI, allowing those with moderate computing resources to train LLMs for their own needs. By adapting from LLaMA-65B, an open-source general-purpose LLM developed by Meta, with a high-quality and diverse set of finance and investment- related texts using a technique called instruction fine-tuning, the HKUST research team has developed InvestLM, a state-of-the-art LLM for the financial domain. InvestLM\u2019s responses have been rated as comparable to those of state-of-the-art commercial LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Claude-2, by financial experts, such as hedge fund managers and research analysts. According to the research team, with its strong capabilities in understanding financial texts, InvestLM can potentially enhance the work efficiency of finance and investment professionals in tasks such as providing investment insights, extracting information from and summarizing financial news and reports. </p><p> Professor TAM Kan-Yan, Dean of HKUST Business School, said, \u201cDeveloping LLMs in-house can help financial firms gain competitive edge through the application of generative AI, while retaining better control over proprietary information and customers\u2019 data. Reflecting HKUST\u2019s lead in embracing generative AI among tertiary education sector in Hong Kong, this project has provided valuable insights for the financial sector on leveraging the fast-growing field of generative AI, in addition to making a powerful financial LLM accessible to the public.\u201d </p></section>",

While it does not directly address the influence of generative AI on political discourse, it provides valuable insights into the broader impact and implications of AI technology on different societal domains. Therefore, the article is relevant to understanding the broader context of AI's influence on society and could potentially inform the discussion on generative AI's influence on political discourse. \n",
                    "relevant content": "The  debate over copyright has been seen  around the world, with some artists angered by AI copying the styles they have sacrificed years to develop, often without consent or compensation. This has sparked questions of intellectual property ownership and legal challenges in countries like the US.\nBut this is only one of the ground-up fears that AI has brought on. Some are worried about losing their jobs, while others say the technology could be used for nefarious purposes.\nAI systems used in recruitment and judicial processes  also risk perpetuating biases  , as the training data they use could be encoded with socio-economic, racial, religious and gender prejudices, experts say.\nAt the same time, the potential of using AI to do good is also there - from driving automation to predicting illness.\nAgainst this backdrop, a  race for AI regulation is taking place  to avert the risks while hopefully reaping the rewards - with action being taken at the global, regional and national levels.\nAn international milestone was logged just a month ago. The first-ever AI Safety Summit, held in the UK on Nov 1, saw the US and China coming together with more than 25 other countries to affirm the safe and responsible use of AI.\nThe landmark agreement also places \"strong responsibility\" on developers of frontier AI to test their systems for safety.\nFrontier AI often refers to the first wave of mainstream AI applications like ChatGPT.\nOn a regional scale, the European Union is in the  final stages of formulating its AI Act  , a far-reaching law that would classify AI systems by risk and mandate various development and use requirements.\nCloser to home, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is planning to  draw up governance and ethics guidelines  for AI, which analysts told CNA are expected to suggest \"safeguards\" that can mitigate identified risks.\nWhile the guide is not expected to translate into regional legislation, it could spur individual member states to create new laws or tweak existing ones to regulate the technology, they added.\nCountries behind the AI curve will also get a leg up as they can benefit from the sharing of knowledge.\n\"The public  should care about AI regulation  because the technology is more pervasive than we normally think,\" said Dr Karryl Sagun-Trajano, a research fellow for future issues and technology at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), pointing out that AI is used in sectors like healthcare, education, transport and crime fighting.\n\nIS AI COMING FOR YOUR JOB?\nThe potential for AI to upend the labour market and disrupt industries has been much discussed. A Goldman Sachs report predicts that as many as 300 million jobs could be impacted by AI automation.\nObservers have warned that faster, smarter and cheaper AI-powered chatbots could replace outsourced call centres handling customer service for many companies.\nThis is especially stark for countries like India and the Philippines, where call centres provide modest-paying work and surveys have shown automation could render over a million jobs obsolete."

The figure for these years is almost as large as the country\u2019s bailout lending over the previous two decades.\nThe  study  by researchers at AidData, World Bank, Harvard Kennedy School and Kiel Institute for the World Economy is the first known attempt to capture total Chinese rescue lending on a global basis.\nBetween 2000 and the end of 2021,  China  undertook 128 bailout operations in 22 debtor countries worth a total of $240bn.\nChina\u2019s emergence as a highly influential \u201clender of last resort\u201d presents critical challenges for western-led institutions such as the IMF, which have sought to safeguard global financial stability since the end of the second world war.\n\u201cThe global financial architecture is becoming less coherent, less institutionalised and less transparent,\u201d said Brad Parks, executive director of AidData at William & Mary in the US. \u201cBeijing has created a new global system for cross-border rescue lending, but it has done so in an opaque and uncoordinated way.\u201d\nRising global interest rates and the strong appreciation of the dollar have raised concerns about the ability of developing countries to repay their creditors. Several sovereigns have run into distress, with a lack of co-ordination among creditors blamed for prolonging some crises.\nSri Lanka\u2019s President Ranil Wickremesinghe  called on China and other creditors last week  to quickly reach a compromise on debt restructuring after the IMF approved a $3bn four-year lending programme for his nation.\nChina has declined to participate in multilateral debt resolution programmes even though it is a member of the IMF. Ghana, Pakistan and other troubled debtors that owe large amounts to China are closely watching Sri Lanka\u2019s example.\n\u201c[China\u2019s] strictly bilateral approach has made it more difficult to co-ordinate the activities of all major emergency lenders,\u201d said Parks.\nSeveral of the 22 countries to which China has made rescue loans \u2014 including Argentina, Belarus, Ecuador, Egypt, Laos, Mongolia, Pakistan, Suriname, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Ukraine and Venezuela \u2014 are also recipients of IMF support.\nHowever, there are big differences between IMF programmes and Chinese bailouts. One is that Chinese money is not cheap. \u201cA typical rescue loan from the IMF carries a 2 per cent interest rate,\u201d said the study. \u201cThe average interest rate attached to a Chinese rescue loan is 5 per cent.\u201d\nBeijing also does not offer bailouts to all  Belt and Road  borrowers in distress. Big recipients of BRI financing, which represent a significant balance sheet risk for Chinese banks, are more likely to receive emergency aid.\n\u201cBeijing is ultimately trying to rescue its own banks. That\u2019s why it has gotten into the risky business of international bailout lending,\u201d said Carmen Reinhart, a Harvard Kennedy School professor and former chief economist at the World Bank Group.\nChina\u2019s lending comes in two forms. The first is through a \u201cswap line\u201d facility, where renminbi is disbursed by the People\u2019s Bank of China, the central bank, in return for domestic currency. About $170bn was disbursed in this way. The second is through direct balance of payments support, with $70bn pledged, mostly from state-owned Chinese banks.\nThe BRI is the world\u2019s largest-ever transnational infrastructure programme. The American Enterprise Institute, a Washington-based think-tank, has put the value of China-led infrastructure projects and other transactions classified as \u201cBelt and Road\u201d at $838bn between 2013 and the end of 2021.\nThe bailout bonanza reveals shortcomings in the design of a scheme described by Chinese leader Xi Jinping as \u201cthe project of the century\u201d.\nOne issue, said Christoph Trebesch of the Kiel Institute, was that Chinese lenders \u201creally went into many countries that turned out to have particularly severe problems\u201d.\nOther deficiencies derived from a dearth of feasibility studies and a general lack of transparency, according to the study.\nBeijing pushed back on Tuesday against the criticisms of its foreign lending practices, with foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning telling reporters that China had entered financing agreements with developing countries \u201cbased on the principles of openness and transparency\u201d. She added that China \u201chas never compelled countries to take its loans, or ever attached political strings to such agreements\u201d.\nSeveral projects became cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for how not to undertake development lending.

It discusses China's Belt and Road Initiative and its impact on developing countries, including the significant expansion of bailout lending and the challenges it poses to global financial stability. The article also highlights the criticisms and concerns regarding the transparency, feasibility, and impact of Chinese lending practices under the Belt and Road Initiative. Additionally, it mentions specific countries that have received rescue loans, their debt restructuring efforts, and the differences between IMF programmes and Chinese bailouts. Furthermore, the article addresses the infrastructure projects and transactions classified as \"Belt and Road,\" providing a comprehensive overview of the topic.\n\n",
                    "relevant content": "Unlock the Editor's Digest for free\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\nChina has significantly expanded its bailout lending as its Belt and Road Initiative blows up following a series of debt write-offs, scandal-ridden projects and allegations of corruption.\nA study published on Tuesday shows China granted $104bn worth of rescue loans to developing countries between 2019 and the end of 2021. The figure for these years is almost as large as the country's bailout lending over the previous two decades.\nThe  study  by researchers at AidData, World Bank, Harvard Kennedy School and Kiel Institute for the World Economy is the first known attempt to capture total Chinese rescue lending on a global basis.\nBetween 2000 and the end of 2021,  China  undertook 128 bailout operations in 22 debtor countries worth a total of $240bn.\nChina's emergence as a highly influential \"lender of last resort\" presents critical challenges for western-led institutions such as the IMF, which have sought to safeguard global financial stability since the end of the second world war.\n\"The global financial architecture is becoming less coherent, less institutionalised and less transparent,\" said Brad Parks, executive director of AidData at William & Mary in the US. \"Beijing has created a new global system for cross-border rescue lending, but it has done so in an opaque and uncoordinated way.\"\nRising global interest rates and the strong appreciation of the dollar have raised concerns about the ability of developing countries to repay their creditors. Several sovereigns have run into distress, with a lack of co-ordination among creditors blamed for prolonging some crises.\nSri Lanka's President Ranil Wickremesinghe  called on China and other creditors last week  to quickly reach a compromise on debt restructuring after the IMF approved a $3bn four-year lending programme for his nation.\nChina has declined to participate in multilateral debt resolution programmes even though it is a member of the IMF. Ghana, Pakistan and other troubled debtors that owe large amounts to China are closely watching Sri Lanka's example.\n\"[China's] strictly bilateral approach has made it more difficult to co-ordinate the activities of all major emergency lenders,\" said Parks.\nSeveral of the 22 countries to which China has made rescue loans  including Argentina, Belarus, Ecuador, Egypt, Laos, Mongolia, Pakistan, Suriname, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Ukraine and Venezuela  are also recipients of IMF support.\nHowever, there are big differences between IMF programmes and Chinese bailouts. One is that Chinese money is not cheap. \"A typical rescue loan from the IMF carries a 2 per cent interest rate,\" said the study. \"The average interest rate attached to a Chinese rescue loan is 5 per cent.\"\nBeijing also does not offer bailouts to all  Belt and Road  borrowers in distress. Big recipients of BRI financing, which represent a significant balance sheet risk for Chinese banks, are more likely to receive emergency aid.\n\"Beijing is ultimately trying to rescue its own banks. That's why it has gotten into the risky business of international bailout lending,\" said Carmen Reinhart, a Harvard Kennedy School professor and former chief economist at the World Bank Group.\nChina's lending comes in two forms. The first is through a \"swap line\" facility, where renminbi is disbursed by the People's Bank of China, the central bank, in return for domestic currency. About $170bn was disbursed in this way. The second is through direct balance of payments support, with $70bn pledged, mostly from state-owned Chinese banks.\nThe BRI is the world's largest-ever transnational infrastructure programme. The American Enterprise Institute, a Washington-based think-tank, has put the value of China-led infrastructure projects and other transactions classified as \"Belt and Road\" at $838bn between 2013 and the end of 2021.\nThe bailout bonanza reveals shortcomings in the design of a scheme described by Chinese leader Xi Jinping as \"the project of the century\".\nOne issue, said Christoph Trebesch of the Kiel Institute, was that Chinese lenders \"really went into many countries that turned out to have particularly severe problems\".\nOther deficiencies derived from a dearth of feasibility studies and a general lack of transparency, according to the study.\nBeijing pushed back on Tuesday against the criticisms of its foreign lending practices, with foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning telling reporters that China had entered financing agreements with developing countries \"based on the principles of openness and transparency\". She added that China \"has never compelled countries to take its loans, or ever attached political strings to such agreements\".\nSeveral projects became cause clbre for how not to undertake development lending. An infamous $1bn \"road to nowhere\" in Montenegro remains unfinished and dogged by corruption allegations, construction delays and environmental issues.\n\"White elephants\" such as Sri Lanka's Hambantota port and Lotus Tower are seen as symptoms of the country's debt crisis, while more than 7,000 cracks were found in an Ecuadorean dam built by Chinese contractors near an active volcano.\nAdditional reporting by Maiqi Ding in Beijing"

By positioning themselves as neutral parties with growing middle classes and lower labour costs, Southeast Asian economies have disproportionately benefitted as companies relocate their China investments amid growing US-China tensions. The region attracted a record US$222.5 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2022 in a post-pandemic bump.\nThis trend continued in 2023, with the US unveiling billions of dollars in investments into Vietnam shortly after upgrading their ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership, including a US$1.6 billion chip factory by Amkor.\nChina, meanwhile, invested heavily in Southeast Asia\u2019s electric vehicle (EV) sector. Carmaker BYD is building a plant in Thailand and Geely announced a US$10 billion investment to develop  Malaysia\u2019s Automotive High-Tech Valley in Perak  .\nIf only US-China competition was all about who could invest the most into the region. Their rivalry has other serious implications.\nObservers should be wary of Washington\u2019s embrace of industrial policy, or government efforts to support strategic industries by eschewing free market policies for interventionism. Even as the Inflation Reduction Act pumps over US$369 billion into the US clean energy sector, other countries might launch their own industrial policies with an arsenal of subsidies to remain competitive.\nIn a worst-case scenario, FDI might be drawn away from the region and towards markets with better subsidies.\n\nGlobal demand for these minerals is expected to surge by 400 per cent to 600 per cent in the next several decades. Any shortage would have knock-on effects on the price of these fixtures, making green transitions more expensive.\n\nA case in point is the 2022 US Commerce Department investigation into eight solar panel companies in Southeast Asia (Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia) accused of skirting US tariffs on Chinese-sourced materials.\nThat the US is heavily reliant on these four countries for photovoltaic panels \u2013 accounting for about 75 per cent on imports in 2021 \u2013 was not enough to defend against bipartisan determination to crack down on \u201cunfair\u201d Chinese trade practices.\nNot only did the Commerce Department find the exporters guilty of skirting tariffs, but the US Congress voted to reinstate tariffs of up to 254 per cent on solar panels from Southeast Asia. President Joe Biden vetoed this legislative bid, but his waiver on retroactive tariffs only extends until June 2024.\nIn effect, Southeast Asian firms are caught between a rock and a hard place. They might be forced to choose between Chinese expertise and the lucrative US market, limiting their ability to grow and support their home country\u2019s green transition.\n\nNAVIGATING ROUGH WATERS, WITH HELP\nThe costs of a failed green transition are especially stark for Southeast Asia. One model by Deloitte predicted that the region could lose US$28 trillion over the next 50 years in losses from tourism, services and manufacturing if its carbon emissions are not addressed.\nWhile these challenges are steep, they are not insurmountable. There is still room to leverage the competition between the two superpowers to support the region\u2019s green transition.\n\nKevin Chen is an Associate Research Fellow with the US Programme at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.",

                            "text": "This is an audio transcript of the  Rachman Review  podcast episode:  \u2018Modi\u2019s moment in the spotlight\u2019\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nGideon Rachman\nHello and welcome to the Rachman Review. I\u2019m Gideon Rachman, chief foreign affairs commentator, the Financial Times. This week\u2019s podcast is about India and the country\u2019s growing influence and power. My guest is Raja Mohan, one of India\u2019s leading strategic thinkers who\u2019s a senior fellow at the Asia Society in Delhi.\nOver the coming months, the world will be seeing a lot of Narendra Modi. The Indian prime minister will pay a state visit to the United States in June and will dine at the White House. In September, India will be hosting the G20 summit of world leaders in Delhi. As American rivalry with China grows, the US is increasingly looking to India as a vital ally. But the western powers have also been disappointed by India\u2019s neutral stance on the Ukraine war. So how does India see its global role?\nNews clip\n(Crowd cheering, drums beating)\nGideon Rachman\nThat was Narendra Modi arriving at a rally in Sydney earlier this week. The Indian prime minister had travelled on to Australia after the G7 summit in Tokyo. Both the Japanese and the Australians are courting India in an effort to balance Chinese power in the Indo-Pacific. The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, paid this fulsome tribute to the Indian prime minister at the Sydney rally.\nAnthony Albanese\nI say to my friend the prime minister, before the last time I saw someone on the stage here was Bruce Springsteen and he didn\u2019t get the welcome that Prime Minister Modi has got. Prime Minister Modi is the boss. (Crowd cheering)\nGideon Rachman\nThat kind of endorsement will court controversy with opponents of Modi who regard the Indian prime minister as an instinctive authoritarian who\u2019s eroding democracy. But it went down a storm with the thousands of Indian expatriates who turned up to watch Modi speak, with whom the prime minister had an obvious rapport.\nNarendra Modi\nNamaste, Australia.\nGideon Rachman\nThe surge in Indian immigration to countries like Australia, Canada, the US and Britain over recent decades is creating intense, if complicated, cultural and political ties between India and the western world. There is also a growing pride and confidence in the way that India interacts with the world, something I noticed at a recent conference on India that I went to in Stockholm and that was addressed by India\u2019s foreign minister, Dr S Jaishankar. After the conference, I sat down with Raja Mohan, who\u2019d also been there. I began by picking up on something that had been much discussed. India has just become the world\u2019s most populous country, surpassing China. Has that contributed to a sense that India\u2019s time is now?\nRaja Mohan\nI think the challenge of managing the population is actually a problem in that population is an asset. But I think making the best use of the demographic dividend \u2014 that, of course, is a major challenge given the post-pandemic unemployment, the whole range of the economic restructuring that\u2019s happening in the world. I would say numbers alone doesn\u2019t talk about India\u2019s opportunity, but I think India\u2019s moment is reflected in the fact that India is one of the fastest-growing major economies. It is in a sweet geopolitical position that its relationship with the west have significantly improved and its weight in the international system is on the rise. So that is what makes it India\u2019s moment. The population is really one part of it but I won\u2019t say it is an unmixed blessing at this point.\nGideon Rachman\nRight. And as you say, India\u2019s weight in the international system is on the rise. And India has this moment, it\u2019s chairing the G20, the G20 summit in Delhi, I think, in September. And it\u2019s striking to me how much the government is making of this. I\u2019m told there are posters about the G20 all over the country. Why is this so important to India?\nRaja Mohan\nMy sense is India has always aspired to be a major global power. But unfortunately, after the second world war, India, they don\u2019t find a place in the UN Security Council as a permanent member. And since then, the idea how does India reconcile its ambition with a larger international role in the Nehru years, of course, Nehru\u2019s model politic, if you will, gave it a voice. But I think then as our economy turned inward under Indira Gandhi, we became more socialist state-led economy, India\u2019s relative weight actually declined. So it\u2019s really in the 21st century when India began to grow at high growth rates, thanks to the economic reforms of the 1990s, that India\u2019s relative rise has taken place. So I would say this is the first big moment when India is actually handling a major international event. The one when I was growing up, the Non-Aligned Summit of 1983, was a big shock. But then that was a show that was not going anywhere. But G20 is the premier international forum. But I think it\u2019s important to add a note of caution. I think the great enthusiasm of Prime Minister Modi. He\u2019s a superb politician. He\u2019s leveraging this great international event for his own domestic ambitions in terms of projecting as a major world leader.\nGideon Rachman\nThere\u2019s an election quite soon, isn\u2019t there?\nRaja Mohan\nYeah, exactly. But I think there is a problem. I mean, partly the G20 leadership is also a poisoned chalice at this point. In a way, multilateralism has never been in such a bad crisis. The great powers are at each other\u2019s throats. So on the geopolitical domain, things are not in a good shape. And on the geoeconomic domain. Just as US-Russia conflict or the Russia-west conflict has complicated the geopolitical scenario, the China-US economic conflict makes it harder to produce outcomes in the economic domain. So I think despite the fact the G20 is a genuinely multilateral institution, its ability to really produce major solutions to the world\u2019s problem is limited. So India has to manage that difficult moment.\nGideon Rachman\nAnd in fact, it looks like talking to the Indians here, they\u2019re not expecting to even produce a joint communiqu\u00e9 at the G20. India will sign up to it but Russia and China basically won\u2019t sign a joint communiqu\u00e9.\nRaja Mohan\nYeah. That\u2019s what happened at the G20 foreign ministers\u2019 meeting some weeks ago, where 18 countries agreed on everything but two, that is, Russia and China, didn\u2019t agree on the Ukraine formulation. So the Indians, of course, say that there was agreement on a large number of other minor issues. But the fact is the Ukraine crisis casts a dark shadow over the deliberations. If India succeeds in preventing things from going worse, that would certainly be an achievement. But my sense is we can manage this without a dust-up between the world leaders, that itself would be a reasonable outcome.\nGideon Rachman\nYeah. And I mean, you said that this is kind of India\u2019s moment in the spotlight. And it\u2019s not just the G20. I think Prime Minister Modi is going to Washington for a state visit.\nRaja Mohan\nHe goes to Washington in June and then goes to Paris, July.\nGideon Rachman\nYeah. So the west is gonna be seeing a lot of Modi.\nRaja Mohan\nYeah, yeah.\nGideon Rachman\nDo you think that indicates what you were suggesting was India\u2019s geopolitical sweet spot that as the west gears up for confrontation with China, India seems to be the indispensable power?\nRaja Mohan\nAbsolutely. I think both on the geopolitical as well as on the geoeconomic domains, I think India becomes an important player, though, our relative size vis-\u00e0-vis China, I mean, is not much because today China\u2019s GDP is five times larger than India\u2019s.\nGideon Rachman\nAlthough the populations are roughly the same.\nRaja Mohan\nYeah. So I think somewhere we will roughly equal to 1990. And then China\u2019s rapid economic growth took them way ahead of us when India grew well, but not as fast as China. So therefore, I think the gap has increased and that gap will remain for a while. But I think what the US and the west are trying to do is in Asia, to build a coalition with the traditional allies of the US, such as Japan, South Korea, Australia. And in India, which is not a treaty ally, to bring an Asian coalition that would produce a regional balance of power. So there India becomes important on the China question. The Russia question is a problem because India\u2019s past legacy, but I think the Americans have managed this quite well so far. On the economic domain, as the US looks to reorder the global economic structures, limiting China\u2019s capability to weaponise the interdependence such that emerged. India\u2019s emerging as an important partner for developing reliable and resilient supply chains to develop safe and trusted digital infrastructure to work with the best on new clean energy supply chains. So I think the restructuring of the global economic order, India occupies a major role because India\u2019s participation will make it important. But I think historically, if looking back the moment in 1947 when India could have worked with the west, it did not happen for a variety of reasons. Then again, in the late \u201960s, I would say when Britain withdrew from east of Suez, there was another moment to work together that didn\u2019t come to pass. I mean, in 1990s we\u2019ve been talking about a courtship between India and the US and India and the west. But I think circumstances are not produced the courtship to really produce some serious outcomes in the region.\nGideon Rachman\nYeah, and of course I talked about why the west has changed its attitude, but it seems to me that India is actually it\u2019s changed really fundamentally after the clash with the Chinese in the Himalayas, the killing of was it something like 20 Indian troops?\nRaja Mohan\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\nGideon Rachman\nIs that your perception as well that that was a real sea change in Indian thinking?\nRaja Mohan\nI think India was beginning to expand its relationship \u2014 economic, political and military \u2014 with the United States starting from 1991 and with Europe as well. But I think the legacy ideology of non-alignment, the strategic autonomy and the idea that non-western countries must come together, whether this with Brics or through other Asian institutions, was always a powerful appeal because that was one of the founding principles of modern India, that we Asians are brothers and we need to work together. But I think the rise of China and China\u2019s assertiveness has cured us of this belief that somehow we Asian brothers will come together to conquer the west. So I think India is quite clear when it makes the formulation that while we are interested in a multipolar world, a multipolar Asia is equally important. That means in the past we were afraid of American hegemony. Today, the problem is to deal with the potential Chinese hegemony in Asia. So I think that fundamentally alters the priorities, the strategies of India for the world.\nGideon Rachman\nYeah, and it\u2019s a bit of a shift even for Modi himself, isn\u2019t it? Because when he came into power, he really made a play to get on with Xi Jinping, and it seemed almost like Xi went out of his way to antagonise Modi. There was this famous incident when he was in Delhi and they were all shaking hands, all very friendly, and at the same time there were Chinese troop movements up in the Himalayas.\nRaja Mohan\nAh that was the first visit where Xi Jinping as the president of China. I mean, Modi took him to his home state, to Vadnagar. They went to the riverfront in the city, sat on a swing, you know, kind of looked, because Modi, as chief minister of Gujarat, did travel frequently to China because he was denied entry to the west. So he regularly travelled to China. He thought really he could pull off the bilateral deal with the Chinese. But I think the problem was not with Mr Modi\u2019s expectations, but I think everyone misread Xi Jinping \u2014 the Americans, the Europeans, the Japanese and the Indians. What we didn\u2019t understand a decade ago was that Xi Jinping saw China\u2019s moment has come. China wants the great power and others must simply accommodate. So it\u2019s not that the Chinese were being particularly nasty to India. They were confronting the US, trying to push the US out of Asia. They were pushing the Japanese. They were taking territory in South China Sea. So they thought the gap between Chinese power and all its neighbours was now so much in Beijing\u2019s favour they could simply do what they wanted and that the US had no option but to accommodate China. So this way I think they made fundamental mistakes that the US is pushing back, US is mobilising coalitions both globally as well as regionally, and I think it has pushed India over the line to get closer to the US.\nGideon Rachman\nSo how real is the sense of threat in India from China? Because of course there\u2019s outrage when Indian troops get killed and there is a border, a longstanding border dispute, there was war in 1962, but do people actually think it\u2019s possible the Chinese could try and seize territory, more territory from India?\nRaja Mohan\nI think it is a long and disputed border. What Xi Jinping has done is to show that he can actually transgress and unilaterally alter the boundary disposition. So for India, I think the problem is not limited to the boundary. That China\u2019s role in south Asia is growing at India\u2019s expense. He\u2019s trying to create bases and military facilities around India\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\nGideon Rachman\nIn Pakistan, Sri Lanka\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\nRaja Mohan\n.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Sri Lanka, in Burma and Bangladesh. So I think the whole push to become the dominant power in south Asia. And finally, the projection of naval power into the Indian Ocean, where Chinese like all great trading nations, China has built a great navy, probably growing at the fastest pace that we\u2019ve ever seen by any nation, building a navy. And then globally actually blocking India\u2019s aspirations at the UN, at the Nuclear Suppliers Group. So I think China is not an existential threat, but it fundamentally constrains my space. It does what it wants on the border. It limits India\u2019s space in the region. So far, I think India has no choice but to push back. And to do that, it really needs the partnership of the US.\nGideon Rachman\nSome strategic thinkers have suggested that there also a fear about control of water supplies in Syria.\nRaja Mohan\nYeah, I mean, all the great rivers like the Indus, the Brahmaputra, started in Tibet. The Chinese do want to do this grand engineering of moving these rivers. They build these dams and what they\u2019ve done, for example, in Mekong and the Mekong River. But I think in south Asia case at least, I mean, the Brahmaputra, for example, is a huge river that comes into Bengal and gets into the Bay of Bengal. There is substantive catchment even below the Himalayas. So I think they can do things on the Indus. But I would say while the design is dangerous for the longer term, in the near term at least it is not going to completely block the river at this point.\n\nGideon Rachman\nAnd so, coming back to the co-operation with the US, with Australia and Japan in the quad, how deep is that? Because, you know, we\u2019re sitting in Europe now in Sweden, which is joining Nato. Now Nato is an alliance for the actual collective security guarantee. What is the quad, as far as you understand it and explain it to us?\nRaja Mohan\nYou know, because of India\u2019s reservations, it is not a military organisation. You can see it has elements of security. For example, they\u2019ve announced last year on maritime security how they will help the smaller countries of the region. So I think what India is doing is really to separate the military function that India does annual military exercises, naval exercises with the US, Japan and Australia called Malabar exercises. So it\u2019s separating the public goods function of the quad, develop a counter capability to China on the softer side \u2014 on infrastructure, on economic assistance and those kind of areas. While on the military side, you do that separately because I think an India that is seen as joining a military alliance would create not only problems for us from China, but also from the Asean and other countries who are already very nervous about India joining the core. But my sense is the US which under the Trump administration, at least, they thought a military alliance is a good idea. But once Biden came, he sees very clearly, look, let\u2019s build up this organisation rather than trying to make it to Nato in Asia because I think, the notion that we can use the quad as a way of doing multiple non-military things, for example, during the Covid pandemic we saw India trying to make vaccines.\nToday they\u2019re pooling a range of information to support the smaller countries to better manage the exclusive economic zones from illegal fishing. So it\u2019s really soft stuff but I think if we can keep building this up, at some point, I would say it will acquire security features. But at this point, it suits India and it seems to suit the United States as well, that build up a relationship rather than trying to force India into a formal military alliance. Because you heard our minister\u2019s suggestion per se at the beginning of this conference that US is not offering an alliance. And India\u2019s too big to fit into that kind of a frame. So this is different, but my sense is given India\u2019s size, this is a better way to go rather than simply put India in a slot within an alliance, because a defeated Europe and a defeated Asia are different reasons at this point to accept the US-dominated alliance system. Here what we\u2019re seeing is really the negotiation of terms of engagement, which has a clear objective, which is to balance China but not as a traditional alliance.\nGideon Rachman\nAnd how much has the Ukraine war and India\u2019s refusal essentially to take sides to condemn Russia at the UN, the fact it continues to buy Russian oil \u2014 how much has that complicated this attempt to get close to the west?\nRaja Mohan\nIt has not really complicated. And I think, well, a lot of people, particularly those central European friends, are very upset. The US clearly sees that there is a Russia problem does not mean the China problem has disappeared. So when you think of the China challenge, India becomes very critical. So I think what the US is doing is cut a lot of slack for India. As long as you don\u2019t buy oil at a high price, below the price cap, that seems to be fine so far unless they completely ban energy engagement with Russia. So I think the US does not see this as a deal breaker, that India\u2019s reluctance to condemn Russian invasion. Second, I think the US is offering India, look, we know you are dependent on Russia for weapons. Is there a way we can help you diversify away from Russia? There I think, I would say that India now is going to be compelled to produce more weapons at home or turn to the west.\nGideon Rachman\nHow much do you think the fact that India gets 80 per cent of its weapons is, if you like 80 per cent of the explanation for why they are (inaudible) with Russia?\nRaja Mohan\nYeah, it\u2019s probably little less now 70 per cent or so, but the total inventory of having bought weapons for 60 years. The inventory is large. So we\u2019re buying very few new weapons from Russia. But since I am locked in a conflict with China, my tanks, my aircraft still need Russian space, Russian equipment. So I think, the dependence is pretty significant. And in a warlike situation with China, it becomes even more important. But my sense is, if this understanding that western capital can come and produce weapons in India, then I think we\u2019re a bit out of time. We can change the situation, but it can\u2019t be done overnight.\nGideon Rachman\nBeing cynical, it\u2019s a huge opportunity for the US arms industry, for European arms industries.\nRaja Mohan\nAbsolutely. And I hope India is smart enough to create the conditions for that investment. We have seen one day, Airbus is joining hands with Tata\u2019s to produce the C-295 transport aircraft. So those are the kind of deals we need to do a lot more, which will increase India\u2019s capability\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\nGideon Rachman\nBut US weaponry is very expensive.\nRaja Mohan\nNot actually. US weapons are cheaper than European weapons because the size of the European market is small, and they don\u2019t produce in the numbers, for example, Rafale versus F-16. I mean, F-16, there are probably more than a thousand aircraft flying around the world. So the scale of production is so large, so the weapons are cheap. And then you can do a government-to-government deal with them. So the Europeans are the more expensive ones. But we\u2019ve been preferring to go to the Europeans, French, for example, because they\u2019re still worried about the Americans might cut it off someday or\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\nGideon Rachman\nAnd that actually is an interesting question because as you alluded, I mean, Modi was not allowed to even travel to the United States for many years because of the allegations about his role in the Gujarat pogrom or whatever you wanna call it. Is the question of human rights in India still a complicating factor? Because I think only yesterday, for example, the state department produced reports pretty critical of religious freedom in India. I just talked to someone in Washington about it and said, how did the Indians take it, and he said, they hate it. You know, they pushed back very, very hard. How do you see that complicating the relationship?\nRaja Mohan\nLook, I think you know, the US, the multiple single-issue groups which have reasonable agency to make these judgments. But I think the US is still a strategic actor, that it is not going to farm out its larger strategy to the single-issue groups. We\u2019ve seen, if you look at last 70 years outside of Europe, the US had to make constant balancing of multiple interests. So the relationship with China for the last 40 years.\nGideon Rachman\nOr the Saudi Arabia\u2009.\u2009..\nRaja Mohan\nYeah, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan. I\u2019m not worried about that the US is suddenly going to turn on India, I mean, I think because the stakes, only China question are so high. And India is a very, very important partner. So I think they will allow groups to say, we do have a good size. There might be protests when Mr Modi goes there, but I think the larger convergence will remain there. I mean, that is deeply structural convergence that is taking place and the US knows how to manage this.\nGideon Rachman\nWhat about the Indian reaction? Because I\u2019ve certainly noticed here in the UK, there\u2019s protests outside the Indian High Commission, sparks a big reaction in India. And so, Modi also has his domestic politics to add.\nRaja Mohan\nSo that\u2019s always been in India, you know, the foreign criticism like, we go back to Indira Gandhi\u2019s days. The foreign hand was a bit heavy. As a new nation trying to build, there is this bristling at any foreign criticism. So that I think, as long as that is within certain bands of tolerance for the US, that the situation in India is not as terrible as in many other countries. And for India, what the US says is not so offensive that it needs to take drastic action. So there will be strong reaction by the foreign office spokesman and that kind of stuff, but I think the stakes for each other are so high, so that\u2019s one. Second, I would say, the US, Biden administration, which came with the formulation democracies versus autocracies, is beginning to adjust a lot. It has to deal with Philippines. It has to deal with Thailand. It has to deal with India. It has deal with Saudi Arabia. This simplistic notion with which they began in 2021, it\u2019s very different after in 2022, after the Ukraine invasion. They need friends. This idea that they can simply tick off everybody because of some concern, those days are gone. So my sense of the strategic discipline demanded by the contestation with China. I will also temper some of the things the Americans are going to do. And for India, the US is the largest trading partner today. Our trade last year is $190bn, including goods and services. In US, we have 5mn Indians out there. And technology, US is the number one partner. On defence it\u2019s a growing partner. So India is not gonna simply squander this relationship. While Modi and his supporters will be upset. So there will be argumentation, but the rest of the story will move on.\nGideon Rachman\nAnd in fact, that people-to-people thing is very important, isn\u2019t it? I mean, this is 5mn Indians in the United States.\nRaja Mohan\nJust minority, Indians are the most successful minority unlike in UK. They do so well because they\u2019re all professionals. Today, they\u2019re getting into the politics, they\u2019re into the media.\nGideon Rachman\nYeah, I mean you can see Microsoft, Google, etc\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\nRaja Mohan\nYup.\nGideon Rachman\nAnd then in the UK, obviously, you have a prime minister of Indian origin. And now a big surge in Indian immigration into Canada and Australia.\nRaja Mohan\nYeah. Canadians are looking for people. So I would certainly, one of the interesting stories is that the Indian diaspora has done the best in the English-speaking world. So there\u2019s a level of comfort, there\u2019s a level of familiarity. So if you see where is Indian migration concentrated in US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand. The Gulf is a different story. The Gulf is really temporary.\nGideon Rachman\nThey\u2019re given opportunities to rise.\nRaja Mohan\nYup, yup. So labour exports, but they\u2019re not going to settle there. But the English-speaking world has really been welcoming to India. In the deepening intimacy we\u2019ll also create problems, because when you have so many of them, they\u2019re also divided, like you see in UK, internal arguments within the Indians themselves, with sometimes affect it. But overall I would say it\u2019s become a really \u2014 the term that we use in the India-UK context is a living bridge. The people-to-people connection does really play a very, very critical factor. We don\u2019t have such relationship with China, with Russia, with anybody else. It\u2019s only with the English-speaking world.\nGideon Rachman\nSo just to conclude, I mean, it\u2019s now kind of accepted that China is going to be \u2014 unless something amazing happens \u2014 that it\u2019ll be one of the superpowers of the 21st century; arguably, already is. How far and how realistic do you think India\u2019s aspirations are to be, you know, one of the great powers of this century?\nRaja Mohan\nI think we have some distance to go, because they said we are in a sweet spot. But we need to convert the sweet spot and do more accelerated economic growth and build stronger partnerships with the rest of the world. It\u2019s also important, I think, to see that while we have, our credit numbers are very high. We\u2019re still at 2,400, 2,300 per capita. And so we should never forget that the developmental challenge internally remains the primary goal that how do we lift up our people into prosperity. But the size gives us external opportunities because already it\u2019s the fifth-largest economy at just $3.5tn, and soon be the third-largest economy. So the size gives us the capacity to engage the rest of the world. But that must be leveraged and done to bring greater prosperity to our own people. But I think we have a chance to be.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nAnd nobody gave us a chance in 1947. But today I think, and there is a chance a rising India can actually lift its own people into a high level of prosperity.\nGideon Rachman\nThat was Raja Mohan of the Asia Society ending this edition of the Rachman Review. Thanks for listening. Please join me again next week.",

I\u2019m Gideon Rachman, chief foreign affairs commentator, the Financial Times. This week\u2019s podcast is about India and the country\u2019s growing influence and power. My guest is Raja Mohan, one of India\u2019s leading strategic thinkers who\u2019s a senior fellow at the Asia Society in Delhi. </p><p> Over the coming months, the world will be seeing a lot of Narendra Modi. The Indian prime minister will pay a state visit to the United States in June and will dine at the White House. In September, India will be hosting the G20 summit of world leaders in Delhi. As American rivalry with China grows, the US is increasingly looking to India as a vital ally. But the western powers have also been disappointed by India\u2019s neutral stance on the Ukraine war. So how does India see its global role? </p><p><strong> News clip <br></strong> (Crowd cheering, drums beating) </p><p><strong> Gideon Rachman </strong><br>\nThat was Narendra Modi arriving at a rally in Sydney earlier this week. The Indian prime minister had travelled on to Australia after the G7 summit in Tokyo. Both the Japanese and the Australians are courting India in an effort to balance Chinese power in the Indo-Pacific. The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, paid this fulsome tribute to the Indian prime minister at the Sydney rally. </p><p><strong> Anthony Albanese </strong><br>\nI say to my friend the prime minister, before the last time I saw someone on the stage here was Bruce Springsteen and he didn\u2019t get the welcome that Prime Minister Modi has got. Prime Minister Modi is the boss. (Crowd cheering) </p><p><strong> Gideon Rachman <br></strong> That kind of endorsement will court controversy with opponents of Modi who regard the Indian prime minister as an instinctive authoritarian who\u2019s eroding democracy. But it went down a storm with the thousands of Indian expatriates who turned up to watch Modi speak, with whom the prime minister had an obvious rapport. </p><p><strong> Narendra Modi </strong><br>\nNamaste, Australia. </p><p><strong> Gideon Rachman <br></strong> The surge in Indian immigration to countries like Australia, Canada, the US and Britain over recent decades is creating intense, if complicated, cultural and political ties between India and the western world. There is also a growing pride and confidence in the way that India interacts with the world, something I noticed at a recent conference on India that I went to in Stockholm and that was addressed by India\u2019s foreign minister, Dr S Jaishankar. After the conference, I sat down with Raja Mohan, who\u2019d also been there. I began by picking up on something that had been much discussed. India has just become the world\u2019s most populous country, surpassing China. Has that contributed to a sense that India\u2019s time is now? </p><p><strong> Raja Mohan <br></strong> I think the challenge of managing the population is actually a problem in that population is an asset. But I think making the best use of the demographic dividend \u2014 that, of course, is a major challenge given the post-pandemic unemployment, the whole range of the economic restructuring that\u2019s happening in the world. I would say numbers alone doesn\u2019t talk about India\u2019s opportunity, but I think India\u2019s moment is reflected in the fact that India is one of the fastest-growing major economies. It is in a sweet geopolitical position that its relationship with the west have significantly improved and its weight in the international system is on the rise. So that is what makes it India\u2019s moment. The population is really one part of it but I won\u2019t say it is an unmixed blessing at this point. </p><p><strong> Gideon Rachman <br></strong> Right. And as you say, India\u2019s weight in the international system is on the rise. And India has this moment, it\u2019s chairing the G20, the G20 summit in Delhi, I think, in September. And it\u2019s striking to me how much the government is making of this. I\u2019m told there are posters about the G20 all over the country. Why is this so important to India? </p><p><strong> Raja Mohan <br></strong> My sense is India has always aspired to be a major global power. But unfortunately, after the second world war, India, they don\u2019t find a place in the UN Security Council as a permanent member. And since then, the idea how does India reconcile its ambition with a larger international role in the Nehru years, of course, Nehru\u2019s model politic, if you will, gave it a voice. But I think then as our economy turned inward under Indira Gandhi, we became more socialist state-led economy, India\u2019s relative weight actually declined. So it\u2019s really in the 21st century when India began to grow at high growth rates, thanks to the economic reforms of the 1990s, that India\u2019s relative rise has taken place. So I would say this is the first big moment when India is actually handling a major international event. The one when I was growing up, the Non-Aligned Summit of 1983, was a big shock. But then that was a show that was not going anywhere. But G20 is the premier international forum. But I think it\u2019s important to add a note of caution. I think the great enthusiasm of Prime Minister Modi. He\u2019s a superb politician. He\u2019s leveraging this great international event for his own domestic ambitions in terms of projecting as a major world leader. </p><p><strong> Gideon Rachman <br></strong> There\u2019s an election quite soon, isn\u2019t there? </p><p><strong> Raja Mohan <br></strong> Yeah, exactly. But I think there is a problem. I mean, partly the G20 leadership is also a poisoned chalice at this point. In a way, multilateralism has never been in such a bad crisis. The great powers are at each other\u2019s throats. So on the geopolitical domain, things are not in a good shape. And on the geoeconomic domain. Just as US-Russia conflict or the Russia-west conflict has complicated the geopolitical scenario, the China-US economic conflict makes it harder to produce outcomes in the economic domain. So I think despite the fact the G20 is a genuinely multilateral institution, its ability to really produce major solutions to the world\u2019s problem is limited. So India has to manage that difficult moment. </p><p><strong> Gideon Rachman <br></strong> And in fact, it looks like talking to the Indians here, they\u2019re not expecting to even produce a joint communiqu\u00e9 at the G20. India will sign up to it but Russia and China basically won\u2019t sign a joint communiqu\u00e9. </p><p><strong> Raja Mohan <br></strong> Yeah. That\u2019s what happened at the G20 foreign ministers\u2019 meeting some weeks ago, where 18 countries agreed on everything but two, that is, Russia and China, didn\u2019t agree on the Ukraine formulation. So the Indians, of course, say that there was agreement on a large number of other minor issues. But the fact is the Ukraine crisis casts a dark shadow over the deliberations. If India succeeds in preventing things from going worse, that would certainly be an achievement. But my sense is we can manage this without a dust-up between the world leaders, that itself would be a reasonable outcome. </p><p><strong> Gideon Rachman <br></strong> Yeah. And I mean, you said that this is kind of India\u2019s moment in the spotlight. And it\u2019s not just the G20. I think Prime Minister Modi is going to Washington for a state visit. </p><p><strong> Raja Mohan <br></strong> He goes to Washington in June and then goes to Paris, July. </p><p><strong> Gideon Rachman <br></strong> Yeah. So the west is gonna be seeing a lot of Modi. </p><p><strong> Raja Mohan <br></strong> Yeah, yeah. </p><p><strong> Gideon Rachman <br></strong> Do you think that indicates what you were suggesting was India\u2019s geopolitical sweet spot that as the west gears up for confrontation with China, India seems to be the indispensable power? </p><p><strong> Raja Mohan <br></strong> Absolutely. I think both on the geopolitical as well as on the geoeconomic domains, I think India becomes an important player, though, our relative size vis-\u00e0-vis China, I mean, is not much because today China\u2019s GDP is five times larger than India\u2019s. </p><p><strong> Gideon Rachman <br></strong> Although the populations are roughly the same. </p><p><strong> Raja Mohan <br></strong> Yeah. So I think somewhere we will roughly equal to 1990. And then China\u2019s rapid economic growth took them way ahead of us when India grew well, but not as fast as China. So therefore, I think the gap has increased and that gap will remain for a while. But I think what the US and the west are trying to do is in Asia, to build a coalition with the traditional allies of the US, such as Japan, South Korea, Australia. And in India, which is not a treaty ally, to bring an Asian coalition that would produce a regional balance of power. So there India becomes important on the China question. The Russia question is a problem because India\u2019s past legacy, but I think the Americans have managed this quite well so far. On the economic domain, as the US looks to reorder the global economic structures, limiting China\u2019s capability to weaponise the interdependence such that emerged. India\u2019s emerging as an important partner for developing reliable and resilient supply chains to develop safe and trusted digital infrastructure to work with the best on new clean energy supply chains. So I think the restructuring of the global economic order, India occupies a major role because India\u2019s participation will make it important. But I think historically, if looking back the moment in 1947 when India could have worked with the west, it did not happen for a variety of reasons. Then again, in the late \u201960s, I would say when Britain withdrew from east of Suez, there was another moment to work together that didn\u2019t come to pass. I mean, in 1990s we\u2019ve been talking about a courtship between India and the US and India and the west. But I think circumstances are not produced the courtship to really produce some serious outcomes in the region. </p><p><strong> Gideon Rachman <br></strong> Yeah, and of course I talked about why the west has changed its attitude, but it seems to me that India is actually it\u2019s changed really fundamentally after the clash with the Chinese in the Himalayas, the killing of was it something like 20 Indian troops? </p><p><strong> Raja Mohan <br></strong> Yeah, yeah, yeah. </p><p><strong> Gideon Rachman <br></strong> Is that your perception as well that that was a real sea change in Indian thinking? </p><p><strong> Raja Mohan <br></strong> I think India was beginning to expand its relationship \u2014 economic, political and military \u2014 with the United States starting from 1991 and with Europe as well. But I think the legacy ideology of non-alignment, the strategic autonomy and the idea that non-western countries must come together, whether this with Brics or through other Asian institutions, was always a powerful appeal because that was one of the founding principles of modern India, that we Asians are brothers and we need to work together. But I think the rise of China and China\u2019s assertiveness has cured us of this belief that somehow we Asian brothers will come together to conquer the west. So I think India is quite clear when it makes the formulation that while we are interested in a multipolar world, a multipolar Asia is equally important. That means in the past we were afraid of American hegemony. Today, the problem is to deal with the potential Chinese hegemony in Asia. So I think that fundamentally alters the priorities, the strategies of India for the world. </p><p><strong> Gideon Rachman <br></strong> Yeah, and it\u2019s a bit of a shift even for Modi himself, isn\u2019t it? Because when he came into power, he really made a play to get on with Xi Jinping, and it seemed almost like Xi went out of his way to antagonise Modi. There was this famous incident when he was in Delhi and they were all shaking hands, all very friendly, and at the same time there were Chinese troop movements up in the Himalayas. </p><p><strong> Raja Mohan <br></strong> Ah that was the first visit where Xi Jinping as the president of China. I mean, Modi took him to his home state, to Vadnagar. They went to the riverfront in the city, sat on a swing, you know, kind of looked, because Modi, as chief minister of Gujarat, did travel frequently to China because he was denied entry to the west. So he regularly travelled to China. He thought really he could pull off the bilateral deal with the Chinese. But I think the problem was not with Mr Modi\u2019s expectations, but I think everyone misread Xi Jinping \u2014 the Americans, the Europeans, the Japanese and the Indians. What we didn\u2019t understand a decade ago was that Xi Jinping saw China\u2019s moment has come. China wants the great power and others must simply accommodate. So it\u2019s not that the Chinese were being particularly nasty to India. They were confronting the US, trying to push the US out of Asia. They were pushing the Japanese. They were taking territory in South China Sea. So they thought the gap between Chinese power and all its neighbours was now so much in Beijing\u2019s favour they could simply do what they wanted and that the US had no option but to accommodate China. So this way I think they made fundamental mistakes that the US is pushing back, US is mobilising coalitions both globally as well as regionally, and I think it has pushed India over the line to get closer to the US. </p><p><strong> Gideon Rachman <br></strong> So how real is the sense of threat in India from China? Because of course there\u2019s outrage when Indian troops get killed and there is a border, a longstanding border dispute, there was war in 1962, but do people actually think it\u2019s possible the Chinese could try and seize territory, more territory from India? </p><p><strong> Raja Mohan <br></strong> I think it is a long and disputed border. What Xi Jinping has done is to show that he can actually transgress and unilaterally alter the boundary disposition. So for India, I think the problem is not limited to the boundary. That China\u2019s role in south Asia is growing at India\u2019s expense. He\u2019s trying to create bases and military facilities around India\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. </p><p><strong> Gideon Rachman </strong><br>\nIn Pakistan, Sri Lanka\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. </p><p><strong> Raja Mohan <br></strong> .\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Sri Lanka, in Burma and Bangladesh. So I think the whole push to become the dominant power in south Asia. And finally, the projection of naval power into the Indian Ocean, where Chinese like all great trading nations, China has built a great navy, probably growing at the fastest pace that we\u2019ve ever seen by any nation, building a navy. And then globally actually blocking India\u2019s aspirations at the UN, at the Nuclear Suppliers Group. So I think China is not an existential threat, but it fundamentally constrains my space. It does what it wants on the border. It limits India\u2019s space in the region. So far, I think India has no choice but to push back. And to do that, it really needs the partnership of the US. </p><p><strong> Gideon Rachman <br></strong> Some strategic thinkers have suggested that there also a fear about control of water supplies in Syria. </p><p><strong> Raja Mohan <br></strong> Yeah, I mean, all the great rivers like the Indus, the Brahmaputra, started in Tibet. The Chinese do want to do this grand engineering of moving these rivers. They build these dams and what they\u2019ve done, for example, in Mekong and the Mekong River. But I think in south Asia case at least, I mean, the Brahmaputra, for example, is a huge river that comes into Bengal and gets into the Bay of Bengal. There is substantive catchment even below the Himalayas. So I think they can do things on the Indus. But I would say while the design is dangerous for the longer term, in the near term at least it is not going to completely block the river at this point. <br><br><strong> Gideon Rachman <br></strong> And so, coming back to the co-operation with the US, with Australia and Japan in the quad, how deep is that? Because, you know, we\u2019re sitting in Europe now in Sweden, which is joining Nato. Now Nato is an alliance for the actual collective security guarantee. What is the quad, as far as you understand it and explain it to us? </p><p><strong> Raja Mohan <br></strong> You know, because of India\u2019s reservations, it is not a military organisation. You can see it has elements of security. For example, they\u2019ve announced last year on maritime security how they will help the smaller countries of the region. So I think what India is doing is really to separate the military function that India does annual military exercises, naval exercises with the US, Japan and Australia called Malabar exercises. So it\u2019s separating the public goods function of the quad, develop a counter capability to China on the softer side \u2014 on infrastructure, on economic assistance and those kind of areas. While on the military side, you do that separately because I think an India that is seen as joining a military alliance would create not only problems for us from China, but also from the Asean and other countries who are already very nervous about India joining the core. But my sense is the US which under the Trump administration, at least, they thought a military alliance is a good idea. But once Biden came, he sees very clearly, look, let\u2019s build up this organisation rather than trying to make it to Nato in Asia because I think, the notion that we can use the quad as a way of doing multiple non-military things, for example, during the Covid pandemic we saw India trying to make vaccines. </p><p> Today they\u2019re pooling a range of information to support the smaller countries to better manage the exclusive economic zones from illegal fishing. So it\u2019s really soft stuff but I think if we can keep building this up, at some point, I would say it will acquire security features. But at this point, it suits India and it seems to suit the United States as well, that build up a relationship rather than trying to force India into a formal military alliance. Because you heard our minister\u2019s suggestion per se at the beginning of this conference that US is not offering an alliance. And India\u2019s too big to fit into that kind of a frame. So this is different, but my sense is given India\u2019s size, this is a better way to go rather than simply put India in a slot within an alliance, because a defeated Europe and a defeated Asia are different reasons at this point to accept the US-dominated alliance system. Here what we\u2019re seeing is really the negotiation of terms of engagement, which has a clear objective, which is to balance China but not as a traditional alliance. </p><p><strong> Gideon Rachman <br></strong> And how much has the Ukraine war and India\u2019s refusal essentially to take sides to condemn Russia at the UN, the fact it continues to buy Russian oil \u2014 how much has that complicated this attempt to get close to the west? </p><p><strong> Raja Mohan <br></strong> It has not really complicated. And I think, well, a lot of people, particularly those central European friends, are very upset. The US clearly sees that there is a Russia problem does not mean the China problem has disappeared. So when you think of the China challenge, India becomes very critical. So I think what the US is doing is cut a lot of slack for India. As long as you don\u2019t buy oil at a high price, below the price cap, that seems to be fine so far unless they completely ban energy engagement with Russia. So I think the US does not see this as a deal breaker, that India\u2019s reluctance to condemn Russian invasion. Second, I think the US is offering India, look, we know you are dependent on Russia for weapons. Is there a way we can help you diversify away from Russia? There I think, I would say that India now is going to be compelled to produce more weapons at home or turn to the west. </p><p><strong> Gideon Rachman <br></strong> How much do you think the fact that India gets 80 per cent of its weapons is, if you like 80 per cent of the explanation for why they are (inaudible) with Russia? </p><p><strong> Raja Mohan <br></strong> Yeah, it\u2019s probably little less now 70 per cent or so, but the total inventory of having bought weapons for 60 years. The inventory is large. So we\u2019re buying very few new weapons from Russia. But since I am locked in a conflict with China, my tanks, my aircraft still need Russian space, Russian equipment. So I think, the dependence is pretty significant. And in a warlike situation with China, it becomes even more important. But my sense is, if this understanding that western capital can come and produce weapons in India, then I think we\u2019re a bit out of time. We can change the situation, but it can\u2019t be done overnight. </p><p><strong> Gideon Rachman <br></strong> Being cynical, it\u2019s a huge opportunity for the US arms industry, for European arms industries. </p><p><strong> Raja Mohan <br></strong> Absolutely. And I hope India is smart enough to create the conditions for that investment. We have seen one day, Airbus is joining hands with Tata\u2019s to produce the C-295 transport aircraft. So those are the kind of deals we need to do a lot more, which will increase India\u2019s capability\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. </p><p><strong> Gideon Rachman <br></strong> But US weaponry is very expensive. </p><p><strong> Raja Mohan <br></strong> Not actually. US weapons are cheaper than European weapons because the size of the European market is small, and they don\u2019t produce in the numbers, for example, Rafale versus F-16. I mean, F-16, there are probably more than a thousand aircraft flying around the world. So the scale of production is so large, so the weapons are cheap. And then you can do a government-to-government deal with them. So the Europeans are the more expensive ones. But we\u2019ve been preferring to go to the Europeans, French, for example, because they\u2019re still worried about the Americans might cut it off someday or\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. </p><p><strong> Gideon Rachman <br></strong> And that actually is an interesting question because as you alluded, I mean, Modi was not allowed to even travel to the United States for many years because of the allegations about his role in the Gujarat pogrom or whatever you wanna call it. Is the question of human rights in India still a complicating factor? Because I think only yesterday, for example, the state department produced reports pretty critical of religious freedom in India. I just talked to someone in Washington about it and said, how did the Indians take it, and he said, they hate it. You know, they pushed back very, very hard. How do you see that complicating the relationship? </p><p><strong> Raja Mohan <br></strong> Look, I think you know, the US, the multiple single-issue groups which have reasonable agency to make these judgments. But I think the US is still a strategic actor, that it is not going to farm out its larger strategy to the single-issue groups. We\u2019ve seen, if you look at last 70 years outside of Europe, the US had to make constant balancing of multiple interests. So the relationship with China for the last 40 years. </p><p><strong> Gideon Rachman <br></strong> Or the Saudi Arabia\u2009.\u2009.. </p><p><strong> Raja Mohan <br></strong> Yeah, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan. I\u2019m not worried about that the US is suddenly going to turn on India, I mean, I think because the stakes, only China question are so high. And India is a very, very important partner. So I think they will allow groups to say, we do have a good size. There might be protests when Mr Modi goes there, but I think the larger convergence will remain there. I mean, that is deeply structural convergence that is taking place and the US knows how to manage this. </p><p><strong> Gideon Rachman <br></strong> What about the Indian reaction? Because I\u2019ve certainly noticed here in the UK, there\u2019s protests outside the Indian High Commission, sparks a big reaction in India. And so, Modi also has his domestic politics to add. </p><p><strong> Raja Mohan <br></strong> So that\u2019s always been in India, you know, the foreign criticism like, we go back to Indira Gandhi\u2019s days. The foreign hand was a bit heavy. As a new nation trying to build, there is this bristling at any foreign criticism. So that I think, as long as that is within certain bands of tolerance for the US, that the situation in India is not as terrible as in many other countries. And for India, what the US says is not so offensive that it needs to take drastic action. So there will be strong reaction by the foreign office spokesman and that kind of stuff, but I think the stakes for each other are so high, so that\u2019s one. Second, I would say, the US, Biden administration, which came with the formulation democracies versus autocracies, is beginning to adjust a lot. It has to deal with Philippines. It has to deal with Thailand. It has to deal with India. It has deal with Saudi Arabia. This simplistic notion with which they began in 2021, it\u2019s very different after in 2022, after the Ukraine invasion. They need friends. This idea that they can simply tick off everybody because of some concern, those days are gone. So my sense of the strategic discipline demanded by the contestation with China. I will also temper some of the things the Americans are going to do. And for India, the US is the largest trading partner today. Our trade last year is $190bn, including goods and services. In US, we have 5mn Indians out there. And technology, US is the number one partner. On defence it\u2019s a growing partner. So India is not gonna simply squander this relationship. While Modi and his supporters will be upset. So there will be argumentation, but the rest of the story will move on. </p><p><strong> Gideon Rachman <br></strong> And in fact, that people-to-people thing is very important, isn\u2019t it? I mean, this is 5mn Indians in the United States. </p><p><strong> Raja Mohan <br></strong> Just minority, Indians are the most successful minority unlike in UK. They do so well because they\u2019re all professionals. Today, they\u2019re getting into the politics, they\u2019re into the media. </p><p><strong> Gideon Rachman <br></strong> Yeah, I mean you can see Microsoft, Google, etc\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. </p><p><strong> Raja Mohan <br></strong> Yup. </p><p><strong> Gideon Rachman <br></strong> And then in the UK, obviously, you have a prime minister of Indian origin. And now a big surge in Indian immigration into Canada and Australia. </p><p><strong> Raja Mohan <br></strong> Yeah. Canadians are looking for people. So I would certainly, one of the interesting stories is that the Indian diaspora has done the best in the English-speaking world. So there\u2019s a level of comfort, there\u2019s a level of familiarity. So if you see where is Indian migration concentrated in US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand. The Gulf is a different story. The Gulf is really temporary. </p><p><strong> Gideon Rachman <br></strong> They\u2019re given opportunities to rise. </p><p><strong> Raja Mohan </strong><br>\nYup, yup. So labour exports, but they\u2019re not going to settle there. But the English-speaking world has really been welcoming to India. In the deepening intimacy we\u2019ll also create problems, because when you have so many of them, they\u2019re also divided, like you see in UK, internal arguments within the Indians themselves, with sometimes affect it. But overall I would say it\u2019s become a really \u2014 the term that we use in the India-UK context is a living bridge. The people-to-people connection does really play a very, very critical factor. We don\u2019t have such relationship with China, with Russia, with anybody else. It\u2019s only with the English-speaking world. </p><p><strong> Gideon Rachman <br></strong> So just to conclude, I mean, it\u2019s now kind of accepted that China is going to be \u2014 unless something amazing happens \u2014 that it\u2019ll be one of the superpowers of the 21st century; arguably, already is. How far and how realistic do you think India\u2019s aspirations are to be, you know, one of the great powers of this century? </p><p><strong> Raja Mohan <br></strong> I think we have some distance to go, because they said we are in a sweet spot. But we need to convert the sweet spot and do more accelerated economic growth and build stronger partnerships with the rest of the world. It\u2019s also important, I think, to see that while we have, our credit numbers are very high. We\u2019re still at 2,400, 2,300 per capita. And so we should never forget that the developmental challenge internally remains the primary goal that how do we lift up our people into prosperity. But the size gives us external opportunities because already it\u2019s the fifth-largest economy at just $3.5tn, and soon be the third-largest economy. So the size gives us the capacity to engage the rest of the world. But that must be leveraged and done to bring greater prosperity to our own people. But I think we have a chance to be. </p><p> [MUSIC PLAYING] </p><p> And nobody gave us a chance in 1947. But today I think, and there is a chance a rising India can actually lift its own people into a high level of prosperity. </p><p><strong> Gideon Rachman <br></strong> That was Raja Mohan of the Asia Society ending this edition of the Rachman Review. Thanks for listening. Please join me again next week. </p></article>",

                            "text": "BRISBANE: US officials regularly present China as an aggressive and expansionist military power while Chinese state sources criticise the United States in similar terms.\nThe verbal sparring has only increased concern about the prospect of a future war between China and the United States\nThe most likely casus belli is seen as arising either from an attempt by China to take control of shipping routes and disputed territory in the South China Sea, or from an attempt to forcibly reincorporate Taiwan into the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nTension has been stoked by a series of myths about the South China Sea. Five of these shibboleths in particular should be refuted.\n\nMYTH 1: SOUTH CHINA SEA IS A VITAL SHIPPING ROUTE\nAs is often pointed out, goods worth between US$3 trillion and US$5 trillion are shipped through the South China Sea every year, amounting to something like a third of the world\u2019s trade.\nThat makes the route vital to China, and helps to explain why President Xi Jinping is so keen on the Belt and Road Initiative, the core of which is the development of land transport routes from China to Western Asia and Europe.\nBut, as Australian winemakers and coalminers have learned, China doesn\u2019t need naval power to control its trade flows.\nFor countries other than China, control of the South China Sea doesn\u2019t matter as much as is commonly claimed. Broadly defined, these waters include a number of shipping routes used by many countries commonly described as \u201cvital\u201d, such as the Straits of Malacca.\nBut a more accurate description would be \u201cconvenient\u201d.

                            "text": "As Japan\u2019s longest serving prime minister, Abe became the most consequential leader after the Cold War, when Japan\u2019s foreign policy approach was predominantly shaped by its economic interests while limiting involvement in international affairs.\n\nHe believed Japan had been shackled by  Article 9. It has imposed unnecessary limits on the military and its role in international affairs  . These limits are visibly ill-suited to address contemporary challenges, namely China\u2019s growing assertiveness, North Korea\u2019s advancing capabilities in ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes, and more recently Russia\u2019s attempts to disrupt the status quo.\nBut Abe struggled to push for the revision of Article 9. Some segments of Japanese society were concerned that revising the constitution would spur conservative leaders to deploy military to overseas conflicts more frequently. Due to this opposition, Abe could not rally sufficient support to hold a referendum \u2013 a necessary step in the amendment process \u2013 to revise Article 9.\nHowever, Abe was successful in reinterpreting Article 9, which lifted a ban on collective self-defence missions. This formed the legal basis for the passage of security bills in 2015 that authorised the Self-Defense Force (SDF) to participate in missions alongside the US and other friendly states, even when Japan is not attacked.\nBut at the heart of it, Abe was a pragmatist, demonstrated in his focus on economics and China. When he returned to power in 2012, Abe was clear Japan needed to jumpstart its economy to respond to China\u2019s economic, political, and strategic rise.\nHis government implemented the so-called three arrows \u2013 monetary policy, fiscal stimulus, and structural reform \u2013 that collectively became known as \u201c  Abenomics  \u201d.\nWhile Abenomics failed to achieve the required reforms to boost national productivity competitiveness, it succeeded on the fronts of monetary and fiscal policy and revitalised the economy.\nAbe\u2019s other win was the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), overcoming domestic opposition \u2013 namely the agriculture lobby \u2013 to sign the high-standard free-trade agreement key to building a free and fair economic system between Asia-Pacific countries.\nThough the Trump administration eventually withdrew the United States which lead the TPP to fall through, Abe\u2019s leadership was central in rallying the remaining TPP members to sign a Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).\n\nAbe also recognised the importance of maintaining a stable working relationship with China, Japan\u2019s largest trading partner.  This is despite points of contention between the two neighbours, like territorial disputes in the East China Sea  or Chinese criticisms of Abe being a historical revisionist.\nNot only did Abe regularly hold meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping, but he also reversed Japan\u2019s opposition towards the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2017. During the 2018 Abe-Xi bilateral summit, both governments  concluded 52 memorandums of cooperation  in areas such as infrastructure, logistics and healthcare  .\n\nTAKING ON ABE\u2019S MANTLE\nIn the wake of Abe\u2019s assassination, there are questions how Japanese society\u2019s perception of the SDF will change since the perpetrator was formerly from the military, albeit for a short period.\nThe SDF\u2019s reputation has incrementally improved since the post-Cold War period due to its relief efforts during natural disasters, protecting Japan from mounting security challenges and contributions to international peacekeeping.\nAbe worked hard in raising the profile and legitimacy of the SDF. He reversed the decline in defence spending when he returned to power in 2012; upgraded Japan\u2019s Defense Agency to a ministry; and proposed for the addition of a third paragraph to Article 9 to legitimately recognise the SDF. It remains to be seen if public opinion of the SDF turns negative.\nFinally, Abe\u2019s departure raises questions on who has the stature to take on his mantle in spearheading debate on foreign policy and domestic political reforms.\nPerhaps  Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is the most likely candidate  after steering the Liberal Democratic Party to victory in two elections. The perceptions of him being a moderate on defence issues could turn out to be a better approach to overcome opposition from Japanese society.\nWhatever the case, Abe\u2019s boldness and pragmatism are good lessons for any leader in Japan to ensure Japan is safe against a worsening strategic environment where three of its neighbours, China, North Korea and Russia are behaving in coercive ways.\nBhubhindar Singh is Associate Professor and Head of Graduate Studies at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) and Faculty Fellow at the NTU-University Scholars Programme, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.",

The president and his family left Colombo on a military jet just hours before he was due to resign in the face of massive popular protests which culminated on Jul 9 with crowds of demonstrators storming the presidential palace. Rajapaksa is believed to be headed for the United Arab Emirates where it is thought he will resign his office. Ranil Wickremesinghe, the country\u2019s prime minister, has taken over as acting president and has  declared a state of emergency  .\nOver the past three months, the tiny Indian Ocean nation has sunk deep into economic malaise.  Inflation is running at more than 50 per cent  and is expected to continue to rise. There are shortages of food and fuel and the country  defaulted on its foreign debt in May  .\nMany are asking whether the army will step in to run the government, at least until order can be restored and a new government formed. But while military intervention might restore order to the streets, it\u2019s unlikely army chiefs will want to take a direct hand in government.\nThere are two reasons for this. The first is cultural. There have been occasions when the country could have buckled to the rule by the military. These were the ethnic civil war years between 1983 and 2009.\nMany hold the view that it was the army which kept the nation from breaking up during this period before winning a decisive albeit controversial victory against the separatists.\nYet, despite the oversized role played by the country\u2019s military establishment, years of hardship, war and human rights abuses, Sri Lankans have steadfastly held on to their democratic civilian government. There were coup attempts in 1962 and 1966 and again in 1991, but these were all thwarted by the civilian government.\nThe other reason is economic. The main problems facing Sri Lanka are a result of economic mismanagement and corruption. A new administration will need to quickly secure international loans or some other form of support to stabilise the economy and resume the importation of food and fuel. This can only be possible with a civilian leader at the helm of such negotiations.\nThe problem a military government would face is that the army is still discredited in the eyes of the international community as a result of mass human rights abuses committed during the civil war against the country\u2019s Tamil separatists.\nIf an army general were to take power now, Sri Lanka will become a pariah \u2013 and would find it almost impossible to raise the foreign investment it so desperately needs.\nThe importance of choosing someone who is able to negotiate loans from international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) was underlined when Rajapaksa appointed Wickremesinghe, the prime minister, to the finance portfolio.\nWickremesinghe had already announced a package of reforms designed to stabilise the economy and planned to present a debt restructuring plan to the IMF by August.\n\nIN DEBT TO BEIJING\nSri Lanka\u2019s economic woe can largely be blamed on corruption among the country\u2019s political elites as well as government mismanagement: Unaffordable tax cuts and grandiose infrastructure projects have emptied the treasury, while an enormous trade imbalance has drained the country\u2019s foreign reserves.\nThe problem has been made worse by the decision to repay debts rather than restructuring. China has been one of Sri Lanka\u2019s biggest creditors and has baulked at any concessions, because it fears that cutting Sri Lanka\u2019s debt \u2013 racked up mainly as a result of Belt and Road projects \u2013 would prompt other debtor nations to do the same and put the Belt and Road programme into jeopardy.\nIn 2017, when Sri Lanka failed on its loan repayment for the US$1.1 billion Hambantota port development on Sri Lanka\u2019s southern coast, it was forced to sign the port \u2013 and thousands of acres of land around it \u2013 over on a 99-year lease. China already owns 43 per cent of the massive Colombo Port City development on another 99-year-lease.\nDelhi-based think-tank, Red Lantern Analytica, said on Jul 9 that China had \u201cemployed its devious \u2018Debt Trap Diplomacy\u2019 to gain a strategic edge over the nation and hold its economy hostage\u201d. This should be a wake-up call to any other non-western countries that have borrowed heavily from China.\nBeijing should also take some responsibility for Sri Lanka\u2019s dire financial straits. But there is little sign, so far, that it will.\nAmalendu Misra is Professor of Politics, Philosophy and Religion at Lancaster University. This commentary  first appeared  on The Conversation.",

So, Operation Prosperity Guardian will most likely be conducted by means of carefully chosen and patrolled shipping routes, with concentrations of naval forces in areas where the threat is considered to be at its highest.\nAlthough this is a complex, demanding and expensive task, escalating the response may be a dangerous alternative.\nWith the US and UK having launched first strikes against targets linked to the Houthis, any retaliatory action could endanger the precarious ceasefire in the Yemeni civil war and runs the risk of widening still further the conflict already engulfing part of the region.\nSo both by defending the trading system on which the whole world depends and trying to limit the dangers of an even greater war in the area, Operation Prosperity Guardian is an important exercise in the defence of global peace and prosperity.\nSmall states like Singapore can do their part too. As a small island state that depends on the global maritime system for its security and survival, Singapore must do what it can to support and uphold the multilateral rules-based system.\nGeoffrey Till is Professor and Adviser to the Maritime Security Programme and Jane Chan is Senior Fellow and Coordinator of the Maritime Security Programme, at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore."

The article discusses Ant International's strategic focus on travel, trade, technology, and talent, and its aim to transform financial services with a growing global presence. The company's focus on technology and trade is evident in its development of cutting-edge digital solutions and its involvement in global digital payments and financial services, particularly through Alipay+ and WorldFirst. This is directly related to the user's query about the technological impact on global trade.",
                    "relevant content": "FORGING A PATH TO FINANCIAL INCLUSION\nHeadquartered in Singapore, Ant International is poised to transform financial services with its growing global presence. With its strategic focus on the 4Ts (travel, trade, technology and talent), the international arm of Ant Group is developing cutting-edge digital solutions designed to  bridge the digital divide  and power the future of global commerce with digital innovation that will benefit a range of communities, from consumers to SMEs and merchants worldwide.\nSaid Mr Yang: \"Despite global economic uncertainties, evolving financial infrastructures, rapid digitalisation and tech advancements offer unparalleled opportunities. Our focus on travel, trade, technology and talent lays the cornerstone for global inclusion and prosperity. We will accelerate innovations in digital payments and commerce to link up these areas of global collaboration.\"\nOne such innovation under the travel pillar is  Alipay+  , the company's flagship cross-border mobile payment service. With a network encompassing 57 countries and regions, it now connects over 88 million merchants with 1.5 billion user accounts, enabling effortless travel and cross-border transactions. Merchants can also leverage the Alipay+ D-store to digitalise their payment processes and operations across multiple platforms and social media channels.\nIn the latter half of this year, Alipay+ saw a 30 per cent growth in total payment volume and a significant increase in daily transactions.\nMost recently, it launched a year-end campaign with partner e-wallets to promote sustainable cross-border travel. Focusing on popular Asian destinations such as Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand, Japan and South Korea, the campaign offered diverse deals through collaborations with global brands and local businesses to ensure a broad selection for travellers. Additionally, it aimed to foster responsible travel behaviours by rewarding the use of digital payments and public transport, as well as promoting exploration of local culture in an effort to support local economies.\nAnt International's technology pillar is embodied by Antom, a suite of platform-level services and toolkits, to help merchants grow their revenue and consumer base across Asia and beyond.\nIn the realm of trade, global digital payments and financial services provider  WorldFirst  (which Ant Group acquired in 2019) has served over one million SMEs engaged in international trade, and plans to extend its solutions to a broader market in Southeast Asia next year. As part of this effort to help SMEs expand globally, it launched the Global Voyage programme in 2022 to help them streamline the process of opening stores on around 30 major e-commerce platforms  such as Amazon and AliExpress  within 24 hours.\nFurther enhancing its portfolio, WorldFirst also signed a memorandum of understanding with Asset World Corporation (AWC), Thailand's leading integrated lifestyle real estate group, to introduce a suite of payment and digital financial solutions for AWC's various business operations.\nIn the first nine months of this year, there was a notable increase in business-to-business buyers from emerging markets using the platform to import goods from China. This surge in activity boosted the total trade value on WorldFirst's platform by 83 per cent compared to the previous year.\nSimilarly,  ANEXT Bank  , Ant International's digital wholesale bank in Singapore  which is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore  focuses on supporting regional micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in their pursuit of international expansion. Since its inception in July 2022, it has seen an average 40 per cent month-on-month increase in cross-border transactions, underscoring its growing importance in the sector. Today, over 65 per cent of its customers are made up of MSMEs."

                            "text": "T  HE WORLD\u2019S  supply chains have taken a knock yet again. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine provoked the biggest commodity shock since 1973, and one of the worst disruptions to wheat supplies in a century. Countries from Hungary to Indonesia are banning food exports to ensure supply at home. The West has issued sanctions against Russia, depriving it of all sorts of parts and technologies.\nThe strain on globalisation comes on top of the effects of the financial crisis of 2007-09, Brexit, President Donald Trump and the pandemic. For years measures of global integration have gone south. Between 2008 and 2019 world trade, relative to global  GDP  , fell by about five percentage points. Tariffs and other barriers to trade are piling up. Global flows of long-term investment fell by half between 2016 and 2019. Immigration is lower too, and not just because of border closures.\nThe war in Ukraine stands to accelerate another profound shift in global trade flows, by pitting large autocracies against liberal democracies. Such confrontation happened during the cold war, too. But this time autocracies are bigger, richer and more technologically sophisticated. Their share in global output, trade and innovation has risen, and they are key links in many supply chains. Attempts to drift apart, therefore, will bring new consequences, and costs, for the world economy.\nAfter the second world war democracies ruled the economic roost. In 1960 America, Britain, Canada, France, Italy and Japan accounted for about 40% of global exports. Autocracies, by contrast, were economically unimportant on the world stage. The Soviet Union accounted for 4% of global trade; China barely featured in the statistics. Average  GDP  per head across the communist bloc was a tenth of America\u2019s. The West was locked in a fierce ideological battle with communist countries, filled with proxy wars and nuclear scares. But in economic terms there was no contest.\nTheir economies were also largely unintegrated. One observer in the late 1950s reckoned that trade between the  USSR  and America was so small that a big shipment could double the total from one month to another. The exceptions in east-west trade\u2014a bit of Russian gas to Europe; a wheat deal in 1972; a vodka-for-Pepsi swap from 1974\u2014were few. A study published by the  IMF  days before the Soviet Union fell said that \u201cforeign direct investment in the  USSR  has been minimal to date\u201d.\nThe communist bloc played by its own rules. Soviet external economic activity largely took place within  COMECON  , a group of sympathetic countries (China and the  USSR  barely traded with each other from the late 1950s, having fallen out). Trade in  COMECON  took place not via money-for-stuff, but in the form of a peculiar system of barter\u2014oil for manufactured goods, say\u2014agreed by governments.\nFrom the late 1970s onwards, autocratic regimes began to open up. In part this was the result of an ideological change, first apparent in China. The death of Chairman Mao in 1976 allowed hitherto heretical views to emerge. \u201cUnless it could expand and modernise its economy more rapidly than it had done in previous decades, China would remain poor, weak and vulnerable,\u201d wrote Aaron Friedberg of Princeton University in a paper published in 2018, describing the ideas of Deng Xiaoping, the leader who spearheaded China\u2019s opening up in the 1980s. A focus on class struggle gave way to a desire for modernisation and development. Further momentum for globalisation came from the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.\nThe West, on the whole, welcomed and encouraged economic liberalisation, believing that it could be a force for good (and for large profits). By bringing countries into the global trading system it would be possible to raise living standards, as well as foster democracy and freedom. A globalised world would also be a more peaceful one, the argument went.\nIn the 1990s globalisation took off. Trade boomed. Annual global flows of foreign direct investment (  FDI  , including purchases of companies and the construction of new factories) rose by a factor of six. In 1990 Russia\u2019s first McDonald\u2019s opened, in Moscow;  KFC  set up shop a few years later. Russian oil companies began directing their exports towards the West. Between 1985 and 2015 Chinese goods exports to America rose by a factor of 125.\nLiving standards certainly went up. The number of people living in extreme poverty has fallen by 60% since 1990. Some formerly closed countries have utterly changed. The average Estonian is now only marginally poorer than the average Italian.\nThe other hoped-for benefit of globalisation\u2014political liberalisation\u2014has faltered, however. Our World in Data, a research organisation, puts countries into four groups, ranging from most to least free: \u201cliberal democracies\u201d, such as America and Japan; more flawed \u201celectoral democracies\u201d, such as Poland and Sri Lanka; \u201celectoral autocracies\u201d, such as Turkey and Hungary; and \u201cclosed autocracies\u201d, such as China and Vietnam, where citizens have no real choice over their leader.\nClassifying political regimes is not an exact science, and involves making assumptions and judgments. Our World In Data counts India as an electoral autocracy since 2019, for instance, which some other sources do not agree with. Nonetheless, it helps give an idea of a broader trend: the waning might of liberal democracies.\nThe share of political regimes that were liberal democracies rose from 11% in 1970 to 23% in 2010. But democracy has retrenched since. Most of the 1.9bn people living in closed autocracies now reside in just one country: China. But lesser forms of autocracy are on the rise, such as in Turkey, where President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has consolidated power during his two decades in office (see chart 1).\nUsing data from the World Bank, the  IMF  and elsewhere, we divide the global economy into two. We estimate that today the autocratic world (ie, closed and electoral autocracies) accounts for over 30% of global  GDP  , more than double its share at the end of the cold war. Its share of global exports has soared over that period. The combined market value of its listed firms represented just 3% of the global total in 1989. Now it represents 30% (see chart 2).\nChina is by far the biggest non-democracy in economic terms, with a dollar  GDP  roughly two-thirds of America\u2019s, making up over half of our group of autocracies. But others, such as Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Vietnam, have also gained in economic clout over the past 30 years.\nAutocracies are now an especially serious rival to democracies when it comes to investment and innovation. In 2020 their governments and firms invested $9trn in everything from machinery and equipment to the construction of roads and railways. Democracies invested $12trn. Autocracies received more  FDI  than democracies between 2018 and 2020. And since the mid-1990s their share of patent applications has gone from 5% to over 60%. China dominates patenting, but on almost all our other measures the economic power of autocracies has soared even after China is excluded from our calculations.\nMany autocracies have remained steadfastly mercantilist. China, for instance, opened its domestic markets where it suited it, but kept whole sectors closed off to allow domestic champions to rise. Nonetheless autocracies have become integrated with democracies to an extent that would have been unthinkable during the cold war. Vietnam, which has been ruled by a single party for decades, for instance, has become a pivotal link in the global manufacturing supply chain. The kingdoms and emirates of the Middle East are vital sources of oil and gas.\nWe estimate that roughly one-third of democracies\u2019 goods imports come from other political regimes. The codependency in some markets is clear. Democracies produce about two-thirds of the oil necessary to meet their daily needs. The rest must come from somewhere else. Half of the coffee that fills Europeans\u2019 cups comes from places where people have weak political rights. And that is before getting to precious metals and rare earths.\nIntegration goes far beyond trade. American multinationals employ 3m people outside democracies, a rise of 90% in the past decade (their total foreign employment has increased by a third). Investors from democracies hold over a third of the autocratic world\u2019s total stock of inward  FDI  . Autocracies have built up huge foreign reserves, now worth more than $7trn and often denominated in \u201cfree\u201d currencies like the dollar and the euro.\n\nBROKEN DREAM\nThis intimacy is now under threat as a third, darker period comes into view. Even before the war in Ukraine, powerful countries were losing interest in a truly global presence. Instead they were seeking to rely more on themselves or to dominate their immediate geographical area. Their new thinking is becoming increasingly enshrined in strategy and policy.\nThe waning appetite for globalisation has a few causes. One relates to greater consumer awareness in the West about human-rights abuses in places such as China and Vietnam. Polls in Western countries regularly find that a high share of respondents support boycotting Chinese goods (whether they would actually do so is another matter). Western companies are being pressed to source goods elsewhere. Concerns over the national-security implications of trade and investment, including industrial espionage, have also risen.\nAutocracies have their own worries. One is that too much integration can cause Western culture to seep across borders, weakening autocratic rule. Deng himself identified the dilemma: \u201cIf you open the window for fresh air, you have to expect some flies to blow in.\u201d\nAnother, bigger worry relates to power. Being part of global supply chains means being vulnerable to sanctions. This was clear from an early stage. In 1989 China faced sanctions after the crackdown in Tiananmen Square. The next year America placed Cuba, El Salvador, Jordan, Kenya, Romania and Yemen under sanctions for various infractions. Several rounds of Western sanctions on Russia, first in 2014 and then again today, bring the message home still more forcefully.\nAlready there is evidence of a crude decoupling. In 2014 America banned Huawei, a Chinese tech firm, from bidding on American government contracts. In 2018 Mr Trump started a trade war with China, with the goal of forcing it to make changes to what America said were \u201cunfair trade practices\u201d, including the theft of intellectual property.  FDI  flows between China and America are now just $5bn a year, down from nearly $30bn five years ago.\nRecent policy announcements and trade deals shed some light on the probable direction of globalisation as the world\u2019s most powerful democracies and autocracies turn away from each other. Countries are signing smaller, regional trade deals instead; democracies are banding together, as are autocracies; and many countries are also seeking greater self-reliance.\nBegin with regional trade deals, the number of which is booming. In 2020 China signed an agreement with 14 other Asian countries, mostly non-democracies. In that year the  ASEAN  group of South-East Asian countries became China\u2019s biggest trading partner, replacing the  EU  . In Africa, meanwhile, most countries have ratified the African Continental Free Trade Area.\nCountries with shared political systems are also coming closer. The CoRe Partnership, an agreement between America and Japan, launched last year and is designed to promote co-operation in new technologies from mobile networks to biotech. The  US  -  EU  Trade and Technology Council, the pointed ambition of which is to promote \u201cthe spread of democratic, market-oriented values\u201d, is working on climate change and strengthening supply chains.\nAutocracies are also forming their own blocs. The stock of long-term investment from the autocratic world into China rose by over a fifth in 2020, even as the amount of investment from autocracies into America barely budged. Saudi Arabia is reportedly mulling selling oil to China in yuan, rather than dollars. Long-term investment from autocracies into increasingly illiberal India rose by 29% in 2020.\nLarge countries in particular, meanwhile, are also turning inward. A big focus of President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, for instance, is \u201csupply-chain resilience\u201d, which in part involves efforts to encourage domestic production. China\u2019s turn in 2020 towards a \u201cdual circulation\u201d strategy includes an attempt to rely less on global suppliers. It wants to release its rivals\u2019 grip on \u201cchokehold\u201d industries, such as chipmaking equipment, which it fears could be used to strangle its rise. India, too, has turned towards self-reliance.\nMany of these efforts could come at a price. Autocracies are notoriously prone to pursuing their own self-interests, rather than banding together. History shows that withdrawing from global trade and investment networks carries huge costs. In 1808 America came close to autarky as a result of a self-imposed embargo on international shipping. Research by Douglas Irwin of Dartmouth College suggests that the ban cost about 8% of America\u2019s gross national product. More recently, many studies have found that it was primarily American firms that paid for Mr Trump\u2019s tariffs. Brexit has slowed growth and investment in Britain.\nRussia\u2019s attempt at self-reliance, by pursuing import substitution on a large scale, building up foreign-exchange reserves and developing parallel technological networks, shows just how hard it is to cut yourself off from the global economy.  Sanctions  by the West rendered much of its reserves useless overnight. The economy was struggling even before the war, and has since gone off a cliff. Unemployment is likely to soar as foreign firms leave the country.\nThe risk, though, is that countries draw the opposite lesson from Russia: that less integration, rather than more, is the best way to protect themselves from economic pain. The world would become more fractured and mutually suspicious\u2014not to mention poorer than it could have been.  \u25a0\nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, business and markets,  sign up to Money Talks  , our weekly newsletter.\nRead more of our recent coverage of the  Ukraine crisis",

For years measures of global integration have gone south. Between 2008 and 2019 world trade, relative to global <small> GDP </small> , fell by about five percentage points. Tariffs and other barriers to trade are piling up. Global flows of long-term investment fell by half between 2016 and 2019. Immigration is lower too, and not just because of border closures. </p><p> The war in Ukraine stands to accelerate another profound shift in global trade flows, by pitting large autocracies against liberal democracies. Such confrontation happened during the cold war, too. But this time autocracies are bigger, richer and more technologically sophisticated. Their share in global output, trade and innovation has risen, and they are key links in many supply chains. Attempts to drift apart, therefore, will bring new consequences, and costs, for the world economy. </p><p> After the second world war democracies ruled the economic roost. In 1960 America, Britain, Canada, France, Italy and Japan accounted for about 40% of global exports. Autocracies, by contrast, were economically unimportant on the world stage. The Soviet Union accounted for 4% of global trade; China barely featured in the statistics. Average <small> GDP </small> per head across the communist bloc was a tenth of America\u2019s. The West was locked in a fierce ideological battle with communist countries, filled with proxy wars and nuclear scares. But in economic terms there was no contest. </p><p> Their economies were also largely unintegrated. One observer in the late 1950s reckoned that trade between the <small> USSR </small> and America was so small that a big shipment could double the total from one month to another. The exceptions in east-west trade\u2014a bit of Russian gas to Europe; a wheat deal in 1972; a vodka-for-Pepsi swap from 1974\u2014were few. A study published by the <small> IMF </small> days before the Soviet Union fell said that \u201cforeign direct investment in the <small> USSR </small> has been minimal to date\u201d. </p><p> The communist bloc played by its own rules. Soviet external economic activity largely took place within <small> COMECON </small> , a group of sympathetic countries (China and the <small> USSR </small> barely traded with each other from the late 1950s, having fallen out). Trade in <small> COMECON </small> took place not via money-for-stuff, but in the form of a peculiar system of barter\u2014oil for manufactured goods, say\u2014agreed by governments. </p><p> From the late 1970s onwards, autocratic regimes began to open up. In part this was the result of an ideological change, first apparent in China. The death of Chairman Mao in 1976 allowed hitherto heretical views to emerge. \u201cUnless it could expand and modernise its economy more rapidly than it had done in previous decades, China would remain poor, weak and vulnerable,\u201d wrote Aaron Friedberg of Princeton University in a paper published in 2018, describing the ideas of Deng Xiaoping, the leader who spearheaded China\u2019s opening up in the 1980s. A focus on class struggle gave way to a desire for modernisation and development. Further momentum for globalisation came from the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. </p><p> The West, on the whole, welcomed and encouraged economic liberalisation, believing that it could be a force for good (and for large profits). By bringing countries into the global trading system it would be possible to raise living standards, as well as foster democracy and freedom. A globalised world would also be a more peaceful one, the argument went. </p><p> In the 1990s globalisation took off. Trade boomed. Annual global flows of foreign direct investment ( <small> FDI </small> , including purchases of companies and the construction of new factories) rose by a factor of six. In 1990 Russia\u2019s first McDonald\u2019s opened, in Moscow; <small> KFC </small> set up shop a few years later. Russian oil companies began directing their exports towards the West. Between 1985 and 2015 Chinese goods exports to America rose by a factor of 125. </p><p> Living standards certainly went up. The number of people living in extreme poverty has fallen by 60% since 1990. Some formerly closed countries have utterly changed. The average Estonian is now only marginally poorer than the average Italian. </p><p> The other hoped-for benefit of globalisation\u2014political liberalisation\u2014has faltered, however. Our World in Data, a research organisation, puts countries into four groups, ranging from most to least free: \u201cliberal democracies\u201d, such as America and Japan; more flawed \u201celectoral democracies\u201d, such as Poland and Sri Lanka; \u201celectoral autocracies\u201d, such as Turkey and Hungary; and \u201cclosed autocracies\u201d, such as China and Vietnam, where citizens have no real choice over their leader. </p><p> Classifying political regimes is not an exact science, and involves making assumptions and judgments. Our World In Data counts India as an electoral autocracy since 2019, for instance, which some other sources do not agree with. Nonetheless, it helps give an idea of a broader trend: the waning might of liberal democracies. </p><figure><span><img src=\"https://cdn.design-system.economist.com/assets/latest/common/static/images/image/image-placeholder.svg\" alt=\"\"></span></figure><p> The share of political regimes that were liberal democracies rose from 11% in 1970 to 23% in 2010. But democracy has retrenched since. Most of the 1.9bn people living in closed autocracies now reside in just one country: China. But lesser forms of autocracy are on the rise, such as in Turkey, where President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has consolidated power during his two decades in office (see chart 1). </p><p> Using data from the World Bank, the <small> IMF </small> and elsewhere, we divide the global economy into two. We estimate that today the autocratic world (ie, closed and electoral autocracies) accounts for over 30% of global <small> GDP </small> , more than double its share at the end of the cold war. Its share of global exports has soared over that period. The combined market value of its listed firms represented just 3% of the global total in 1989. Now it represents 30% (see chart 2). </p><figure><span><img src=\"https://cdn.design-system.economist.com/assets/latest/common/static/images/image/image-placeholder.svg\" alt=\"\"></span></figure><p> China is by far the biggest non-democracy in economic terms, with a dollar <small> GDP </small> roughly two-thirds of America\u2019s, making up over half of our group of autocracies. But others, such as Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Vietnam, have also gained in economic clout over the past 30 years. </p><p> Autocracies are now an especially serious rival to democracies when it comes to investment and innovation. In 2020 their governments and firms invested $9trn in everything from machinery and equipment to the construction of roads and railways. Democracies invested $12trn. Autocracies received more <small> FDI </small> than democracies between 2018 and 2020. And since the mid-1990s their share of patent applications has gone from 5% to over 60%. China dominates patenting, but on almost all our other measures the economic power of autocracies has soared even after China is excluded from our calculations. </p><p> Many autocracies have remained steadfastly mercantilist. China, for instance, opened its domestic markets where it suited it, but kept whole sectors closed off to allow domestic champions to rise. Nonetheless autocracies have become integrated with democracies to an extent that would have been unthinkable during the cold war. Vietnam, which has been ruled by a single party for decades, for instance, has become a pivotal link in the global manufacturing supply chain. The kingdoms and emirates of the Middle East are vital sources of oil and gas. </p><p> We estimate that roughly one-third of democracies\u2019 goods imports come from other political regimes. The codependency in some markets is clear. Democracies produce about two-thirds of the oil necessary to meet their daily needs. The rest must come from somewhere else. Half of the coffee that fills Europeans\u2019 cups comes from places where people have weak political rights. And that is before getting to precious metals and rare earths. </p><p> Integration goes far beyond trade. American multinationals employ 3m people outside democracies, a rise of 90% in the past decade (their total foreign employment has increased by a third). Investors from democracies hold over a third of the autocratic world\u2019s total stock of inward <small> FDI </small> . Autocracies have built up huge foreign reserves, now worth more than $7trn and often denominated in \u201cfree\u201d currencies like the dollar and the euro. </p><h2> Broken dream </h2><p> This intimacy is now under threat as a third, darker period comes into view. Even before the war in Ukraine, powerful countries were losing interest in a truly global presence. Instead they were seeking to rely more on themselves or to dominate their immediate geographical area. Their new thinking is becoming increasingly enshrined in strategy and policy. </p><p> The waning appetite for globalisation has a few causes. One relates to greater consumer awareness in the West about human-rights abuses in places such as China and Vietnam. Polls in Western countries regularly find that a high share of respondents support boycotting Chinese goods (whether they would actually do so is another matter). Western companies are being pressed to source goods elsewhere. Concerns over the national-security implications of trade and investment, including industrial espionage, have also risen. </p><p> Autocracies have their own worries. One is that too much integration can cause Western culture to seep across borders, weakening autocratic rule. Deng himself identified the dilemma: \u201cIf you open the window for fresh air, you have to expect some flies to blow in.\u201d </p><p> Another, bigger worry relates to power. Being part of global supply chains means being vulnerable to sanctions. This was clear from an early stage. In 1989 China faced sanctions after the crackdown in Tiananmen Square. The next year America placed Cuba, El Salvador, Jordan, Kenya, Romania and Yemen under sanctions for various infractions. Several rounds of Western sanctions on Russia, first in 2014 and then again today, bring the message home still more forcefully. </p><p> Already there is evidence of a crude decoupling. In 2014 America banned Huawei, a Chinese tech firm, from bidding on American government contracts. In 2018 Mr Trump started a trade war with China, with the goal of forcing it to make changes to what America said were \u201cunfair trade practices\u201d, including the theft of intellectual property. <small> FDI </small> flows between China and America are now just $5bn a year, down from nearly $30bn five years ago. </p><p> Recent policy announcements and trade deals shed some light on the probable direction of globalisation as the world\u2019s most powerful democracies and autocracies turn away from each other. Countries are signing smaller, regional trade deals instead; democracies are banding together, as are autocracies; and many countries are also seeking greater self-reliance. </p><p> Begin with regional trade deals, the number of which is booming. In 2020 China signed an agreement with 14 other Asian countries, mostly non-democracies. In that year the <small> ASEAN </small> group of South-East Asian countries became China\u2019s biggest trading partner, replacing the <small> EU </small> . In Africa, meanwhile, most countries have ratified the African Continental Free Trade Area. </p><p> Countries with shared political systems are also coming closer. The CoRe Partnership, an agreement between America and Japan, launched last year and is designed to promote co-operation in new technologies from mobile networks to biotech. The <small> US </small> - <small> EU </small> Trade and Technology Council, the pointed ambition of which is to promote \u201cthe spread of democratic, market-oriented values\u201d, is working on climate change and strengthening supply chains. </p><p> Autocracies are also forming their own blocs. The stock of long-term investment from the autocratic world into China rose by over a fifth in 2020, even as the amount of investment from autocracies into America barely budged. Saudi Arabia is reportedly mulling selling oil to China in yuan, rather than dollars. Long-term investment from autocracies into increasingly illiberal India rose by 29% in 2020. </p><p> Large countries in particular, meanwhile, are also turning inward. A big focus of President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, for instance, is \u201csupply-chain resilience\u201d, which in part involves efforts to encourage domestic production. China\u2019s turn in 2020 towards a \u201cdual circulation\u201d strategy includes an attempt to rely less on global suppliers. It wants to release its rivals\u2019 grip on \u201cchokehold\u201d industries, such as chipmaking equipment, which it fears could be used to strangle its rise. India, too, has turned towards self-reliance. </p><p> Many of these efforts could come at a price. Autocracies are notoriously prone to pursuing their own self-interests, rather than banding together. History shows that withdrawing from global trade and investment networks carries huge costs. In 1808 America came close to autarky as a result of a self-imposed embargo on international shipping. Research by Douglas Irwin of Dartmouth College suggests that the ban cost about 8% of America\u2019s gross national product. More recently, many studies have found that it was primarily American firms that paid for Mr Trump\u2019s tariffs. Brexit has slowed growth and investment in Britain. </p><p> Russia\u2019s attempt at self-reliance, by pursuing import substitution on a large scale, building up foreign-exchange reserves and developing parallel technological networks, shows just how hard it is to cut yourself off from the global economy. <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/21808194/can-foreign-currency-reserves-be-sanction-proofed/21808194\"> Sanctions </a> by the West rendered much of its reserves useless overnight. The economy was struggling even before the war, and has since gone off a cliff. Unemployment is likely to soar as foreign firms leave the country. </p><p> The risk, though, is that countries draw the opposite lesson from Russia: that less integration, rather than more, is the best way to protect themselves from economic pain. The world would become more fractured and mutually suspicious\u2014not to mention poorer than it could have been. <span> \u25a0 </span></p><p><em><em> For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, business and markets, <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/moneytalks/\"> sign up to Money Talks </a> , our weekly newsletter. </em></em></p><p><em> Read more of our recent coverage of the <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis\"> Ukraine crisis </a></em></p>",

                    "relevant content": "T  HE WORLD'S  supply chains have taken a knock yet again. Russia's invasion of Ukraine provoked the biggest commodity shock since 1973, and one of the worst disruptions to wheat supplies in a century. Countries from Hungary to Indonesia are banning food exports to ensure supply at home. The West has issued sanctions against Russia, depriving it of all sorts of parts and technologies.\nThe strain on globalisation comes on top of the effects of the financial crisis of 2007-09, Brexit, President Donald Trump and the pandemic.

Some formerly closed countries have utterly changed. The average Estonian is now only marginally poorer than the average Italian.\nThe other hoped-for benefit of globalisationpolitical liberalisationhas faltered, however. Our World in Data, a research organisation, puts countries into four groups, ranging from most to least free: \"liberal democracies\", such as America and Japan; more flawed \"electoral democracies\", such as Poland and Sri Lanka; \"electoral autocracies\", such as Turkey and Hungary; and \"closed autocracies\", such as China and Vietnam, where citizens have no real choice over their leader.\nClassifying political regimes is not an exact science, and involves making assumptions and judgments. Our World In Data counts India as an electoral autocracy since 2019, for instance, which some other sources do not agree with. Nonetheless, it helps give an idea of a broader trend: the waning might of liberal democracies.\nThe share of political regimes that were liberal democracies rose from 11% in 1970 to 23% in 2010. But democracy has retrenched since. Most of the 1.9bn people living in closed autocracies now reside in just one country: China. But lesser forms of autocracy are on the rise, such as in Turkey, where President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has consolidated power during his two decades in office (see chart 1).\nUsing data from the World Bank, the  IMF  and elsewhere, we divide the global economy into two. We estimate that today the autocratic world (ie, closed and electoral autocracies) accounts for over 30% of global  GDP  , more than double its share at the end of the cold war. Its share of global exports has soared over that period. The combined market value of its listed firms represented just 3% of the global total in 1989. Now it represents 30% (see chart 2).\nChina is by far the biggest non-democracy in economic terms, with a dollar  GDP  roughly two-thirds of America's, making up over half of our group of autocracies. But others, such as Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Vietnam, have also gained in economic clout over the past 30 years.\nAutocracies are now an especially serious rival to democracies when it comes to investment and innovation. In 2020 their governments and firms invested $9trn in everything from machinery and equipment to the construction of roads and railways. Democracies invested $12trn. Autocracies received more  FDI  than democracies between 2018 and 2020. And since the mid-1990s their share of patent applications has gone from 5% to over 60%. China dominates patenting, but on almost all our other measures the economic power of autocracies has soared even after China is excluded from our calculations.\nMany autocracies have remained steadfastly mercantilist. China, for instance, opened its domestic markets where it suited it, but kept whole sectors closed off to allow domestic champions to rise. Nonetheless autocracies have become integrated with democracies to an extent that would have been unthinkable during the cold war. Vietnam, which has been ruled by a single party for decades, for instance, has become a pivotal link in the global manufacturing supply chain.

Half of the coffee that fills Europeans' cups comes from places where people have weak political rights.

American multinationals employ 3m people outside democracies, a rise of 90% in the past decade (their total foreign employment has increased by a third). Investors from democracies hold over a third of the autocratic world's total stock of inward  FDI  . Autocracies have built up huge foreign reserves, now worth more than $7trn and often denominated in \"free\" currencies like the dollar and the euro.\n\nBROKEN DREAM\nThis intimacy is now under threat as a third, darker period comes into view.

Long-term investment from autocracies into increasingly illiberal India rose by 29% in 2020.\nLarge countries in particular, meanwhile, are also turning inward. A big focus of President Joe Biden's administration, for instance, is \"supply-chain resilience\", which in part involves efforts to encourage domestic production. China's turn in 2020 towards a \"dual circulation\" strategy includes an attempt to rely less on global suppliers. It wants to release its rivals' grip on \"chokehold\" industries, such as chipmaking equipment, which it fears could be used to strangle its rise. India, too, has turned towards self-reliance.\nMany of these efforts could come at a price. Autocracies are notoriously prone to pursuing their own self-interests, rather than banding together. History shows that withdrawing from global trade and investment networks carries huge costs. In 1808 America came close to autarky as a result of a self-imposed embargo on international shipping. Research by Douglas Irwin of Dartmouth College suggests that the ban cost about 8% of America's gross national product. More recently, many studies have found that it was primarily American firms that paid for Mr Trump's tariffs. Brexit has slowed growth and investment in Britain.\nRussia's attempt at self-reliance, by pursuing import substitution on a large scale, building up foreign-exchange reserves and developing parallel technological networks, shows just how hard it is to cut yourself off from the global economy.  Sanctions  by the West rendered much of its reserves useless overnight. The economy was struggling even before the war, and has since gone off a cliff. Unemployment is likely to soar as foreign firms leave the country.\nThe risk, though, is that countries draw the opposite lesson from Russia: that less integration, rather than more, is the best way to protect themselves from economic pain. The world would become more fractured and mutually suspiciousnot to mention poorer than it could have been.  \nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, business and markets,  sign up to Money Talks  , our weekly newsletter.\nRead more of our recent coverage of the  Ukraine crisis"

While marmalade's actual impact on the trade war is minimal due to the relatively low export value, the article provides insight into the global trade dynamics and the specific impact of the trade tensions between China and the United States. This is relevant to the topic of global trade history as it provides a contemporary example of how trade disputes can affect specific products and trade relationships between countries.",
                    "relevant content": "Marmalade  made the front page  of this newspaper's business section last week. This came as no surprise in the Vines household, where marmalade makes a daily appearance on the breakfast table, but the more prosaic reason was that this fine product has become a bit player in the  Sino-US trade war  .\n\nThe minds designing the  new US tariff regime  for Chinese imports decided to include marmalade in the list of 7,000 categories of Chinese products targeted for tariffs. As a mere US$12,330 worth of marmalade was exported to the  United States  from  China  last year, it is safe to say its impact on the trade war will not be decisive."

It\u2019s lunchtime at 328 Katong Laksa and the popular Singapore joint is packed.\n\nThis was far from the first culinary clash between the neighbours.\nWhen CNN included cendol in a 2018 list of 50 best desserts in the world - and said it was Singaporean - some Malaysians lost their cool.\nWhen Singapore applied that year to have its hawker culture inscribed by the United Nations as intangible cultural heritage, there were those in Malaysia who objected on the grounds that theirs was more deserving.\nAnd when McDonald\u2019s dedicated the nasi lemak burger to Singapore for its National Day in 2017, Malaysians scoffed and said it was their national dish.\nFurther back in 2010, a former tourism minister stir-fried a storm in a wok when she laid Malaysia's claim to various dishes including laksa, nasi lemak and bak kut teh, drawing the ire of some foodies in Singapore.\nWith each episode came reams of articles and hours of videos asking the question: Is (insert food) from Singapore or Malaysia?\nAs it turns out, the origins of most local food in Singapore and Malaysia are harder to untangle than cold vermicelli - and one dish with particularly complicated roots is laksa.\n\n\u201cEVERY BOWL HAS A STORY\u201d\n\nBut is \"Singapore laksa\" just Katong laksa?\nIn The Food of Singapore Malays, a book written by historian Khir Johari, lies a recipe for a \"Laksa Singapura\" which uses ground fish pulp instead of prawns.\nInstead of candlenut, there is coconut cream and kerisik, or toasted grated coconut. There\u2019s also dried shrimp and ikan bilis in the spice paste.\nIt's like a fish ragu, said Mr Khir, drawing an analogy to Italian meat sauces.\nToday, this fish-based, less spicy laksa can still be found at Geylang Serai Market as laksa Siglap, named after the area where it was once sold by many hawkers.\nMr Khir explained that laksa Siglap comes from the Johor-Riau sphere of influence which Singapore was historically a part of - and pre-dates the better-known Katong laksa.\n\nSo some clues to laksa's convoluted past have endured - in its etymology, in kitchen tools like laksa chap or a press once used to handmake noodles, and in trade records detailing the flow of ingredients from one port to another.\nYet these historical dots are so far apart that any attempt to join them into a convenient narrative would still require filling in expanses of space with assumptions and leaps of logic - like the proverbial blind men feeling an elephant.\nEven the experts I consulted had differing strands of laksa lore - though they ultimately agreed on the dish being a local, Southeast Asian creation.\nDr Ong Jin Teong, who has written books on Penang and Nyonya heritage food, described laksa as fundamentally a confluence of cultures.\n\u201cAll food is fusion food. Food from neighbouring countries, regions or communities will influence the evolution of food over time,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat then to make of the ostensible, admittedly media-hyped separation and schism between Singapore and Malaysia it comes to food?\nThe truth is that food transcends all boundaries, Mr Khir emphasised.\n\u201cWe are at a point now (where) we are more enlightened ... Some of these dishes have really been around before the existence of various geopolitical entities,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe whole idea of making claims and nationalising food is a pretty silly thing, and rather futile.\u201d\n\nWHAT FOOD DEFINES AND SYMBOLISES\nYet what Tai said about Singapore pilfering Malaysian food still stung - but perhaps also due to the context of his jibes, which included claims that  the island nation's attractions were all \u201cman-made\u201d.\nAt the same time, the Malaysian seemed annoyed as he recounted how recommending local cuisine to friends would prompt questions like \u201cisn\u2019t that from Singapore?\u201d\nAnd the Taiwanese host said: \u201cMany people can\u2019t tell Singapore and Malaysia apart, there are some food we think is from Singapore, but others say, no, it\u2019s from Malaysia - you can\u2019t tell.\u201d\n\nMany a Singaporean or Malaysian will readily admit that food is often on their minds and close to their hearts. But what fuels an apparent reflex to just as quickly stake national claim to a dish - as if it were one's own possession?\nFood can be used to form a nation\u2019s identity, connecting its citizens, said Dr Keri Matwick, a linguist who studies food and language.\n\u201cNational cuisines rely on concepts of authenticity and tradition, which determine what is considered typical or unique,\" the senior lecturer at Nanyang Technological University explained.\n\"At the same time, food can be used to define borders - especially important for neighbouring countries like Singapore and Malaysia.\n\u201cThe value of a dish like laksa, chilli crab, nasi lemak or pad thai as a national symbol comes from its daily consumption among the locals.\"\nFood can define us; trigger nostalgia; and evoke memories of people, places and events, she added.\n\n\"THE GREAT STOMACH\"\nFood rivalries, and the stream of public sentiments and \"misconceptions\" that accompany each episode, are part of the reason Dr Ong writes about food.\n\"Unfortunately, most of the people who made the comments, including the politicians, don\u2019t know much about their local food, or the origins,\" he said.\n\"We should all get together and promote our ASEAN dishes and talk about our local variations, similarities and differences.\"\nAcross the Johor strait, Mr Ronald Gan, president of the Melaka Peranakan Association, is in the midst of the Wangkang - an 11-day ceremony recognised by the UN as intangible cultural heritage.\nAt the end of it, a Wangkang or deity's barge is consumed by fire, giving deliverance to wandering souls on board the boat.\nIn his role, Mr Gan works with groups in China's Xiamen city to preserve the traditions of the ritual. He believes a similarly collaborative approach is necessary for something as culturally significant as food.",

People with this dual identity see themselves as Taiwanese who are successors of Chinese culture, rather than a Chinese nation, according to Dr Chen Fang-yu, assistant professor of political science at Soochow University in Taiwan.\nThat refers to the traditional folk beliefs and customs and use of traditional Chinese script that continue in Taiwan, he said.\n\u201cI do believe that in Taiwan, yes, we are a successor of Chinese culture. But with a mixture, or we create a unique Taiwanese culture.\u201d\nDr Chen, whose research focuses on identity, said there is now largely consensus around Taiwanese identification, and that it strengthens in younger cohorts.\nA survey he conducted this semester among university students showed more than 80 per cent identified as Taiwanese \u2013 20 percentage points above the national average.\nSuch numbers indicate that for the majority of Taiwan\u2019s people, at a personal level, Taiwanese identification is no longer a struggle. In fact, it has been on the rise since 1994 when Taiwanese identification overtook Chinese identification in NCCU\u2019s survey for the first time.\nDr Chen linked this to the Qiandao Lake incident that year, in which 24 Taiwanese tourists were killed by robbers in Zhejiang province.\nThere was a public outcry in Taiwan over the murders and the way mainland authorities handled the investigation.\nAnother sharp decline in Chinese identification happened after Taiwan's first direct presidential election in 1996 \u2013 a four-way contest in which the Kuomintang\u2019s (KMT) Lee Teng-hui emerged victorious and went on to accelerate Taiwan\u2019s democratic transition.\nMr Lee was Taiwan\u2019s first islander (benshengren) president. While Taiwan\u2019s mainlanders (waishengren) descend from migrants who fled mainland China after the KMT was defeated at the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, islanders trace their roots further back in history.\nThe islander-mainlander divide has been a faultline in Taiwanese identity and history, most notably in the Feb 28 incident in 1947, when the KMT government led by mainlanders violently suppressed an uprising by islanders.\nMs Chen, the cooking instructor, said she is \u201cnot a political person\u201d. She has not always exercised her vote. But for her, the 1996 election was a \u201ccrucial time\u201d for Taiwan in which she felt strongly about making her vote count.\nShe recalled the impression the eventual president Mr Lee made \u2013 she was struck by his familiar Taiwanese accent as much as by his intelligence and leadership.\n\"Before that, our imagined community, imagined boundary, is the whole mainland,\u201d said Dr Chen, referring to founding president Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s desire to reconquer the territory his forces lost in the Chinese Civil War.\n\u201cBut from this time, we know that we can elect our own leader in Taiwan, and only in Taiwan, not for the mainland,\u201d the professor said of the 1996 vote.\nIn the years since, Taiwanese identification has twice peaked around disparate events set in motion by former Taiwanese president Ma and Chinese President Xi Jinping, leading observers to joke that both men are \u201cgodfathers\u201d of Taiwanese identity, said Dr Chen.\nIn 2014, Mr Ma\u2019s KMT-led administration tried to push the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement through parliament without a clause-by-clause review. Sunflower Movement protestors occupied the Legislative Yuan to oppose the move, and Taiwanese identification crossed the 60 per cent mark for the first time that year.\nFive years later, Taiwanese identification hit an all-time high of more than 64 per cent during the 2019 anti-extradition law protests in Hong Kong, which prompted a police crackdown and Mr Xi\u2019s imposition of a national security law.\n\nIDENTITY IN THIS ELECTION\nYet the identity issue continues to be central to Taiwanese politics, a point made by Dr Nathan F Batto, associate research fellow in political science at Academia Sinica, in the Asian Journal of Comparative Politics in 2018.\n\u201cIf a society is marked by a single deep and salient political cleavage, voters generally continue to vote along cleavage lines,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cNational identity stands alone as the primary factor shaping politics over the past quarter century. Essentially, Taiwanese politics boil down to the question, \u2018Who are we?\u2019 More specifically, \u2018Are we Chinese? Or are we Taiwanese?\u2019\u201d\nIt\u2019s no different in this election, though the identity issue has played out in slightly different ways.\nDespite the majority identifying as Taiwanese in 2024, the distinction between islander and mainlander Taiwanese remains salient.\nThe KMT\u2019s presidential candidate Mr Hou is an islander who was born in Chiayi county, and has been noted to sound more fluent in Taiwanese than Mandarin.\nDr Chen said Mr Hou is considered a \u201cweak\u201d candidate to mobilise the mainlander vote. While mainlanders only made up 13 per cent of Taiwan\u2019s population in the 1990 census \u2013 the last census to specifically track this group \u2013 they tend to occupy influential positions in the media and public service, he said.\nA majority of KMT members tend to be mainlanders, and the party\u2019s structure gives them the power to vote for party leaders, allowing them to dominate its decision-making process, he added.\nThis perceived disadvantage of Mr Hou is being balanced out by the rest of the KMT\u2019s slate, said Dr Chen.\nMr Hou\u2019s running mate is television personality Jaw Shaw-kong, 73, while the party\u2019s top pick for legislator-at-large \u2013 who could become speaker if the KMT wins a legislative majority \u2013 is former Kaohsiung mayor Han Kuo-yu.\nBoth Mr Jaw and Mr Han are popular with mainlander voters as they are considered \u201cdeep blue\u201d, pro-China figures.\nThis election cycle also saw the identity issue intertwined with nationality, following speculation about the nationalities, and hence loyalties, of two vice-presidential candidates \u2013 Ms Hsiao Bi-khim of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and Ms Cynthia Wu of the Taiwan People\u2019s Party (TPP).\nMs Hsiao, 52, was born in Japan to a Taiwanese father and American mother. She grew up in Tainan, went to college in the United States, and served as Taiwan\u2019s representative to the US until she stepped down to contest the election.\nMs Wu, 45, was born in the United States to Taiwanese parents, and has studied in Taiwan, the US and the United Kingdom. She worked as an investment analyst in London before returning to Taipei to work for her family business, the Shin Kong Group, and became a legislator in 2022.\nDual nationals are barred from running for president or vice-president under Taiwanese law. In early December, Ms Hsiao and Ms Wu\u2019s nationalities became fodder for online speculation, with rumours that both candidates still held US citizenship.\nBoth Ms Hsiao and Ms Wu had their nationalities verified by the Central Election Commission, which deemed them eligible to run in early December. The non-profit Taiwan FactCheck Center also came out to debunk the rumours.\nDr Chen said the nationality controversy has been an exception in this election, compared to the past where the question of national identity is not openly discussed in such terms.",

While mainlanders only made up 13 per cent of Taiwan\u2019s population in the 1990 census \u2013 the last census to specifically track this group \u2013 they tend to occupy influential positions in the media and public service, he said. </p><p> A majority of KMT members tend to be mainlanders, and the party\u2019s structure gives them the power to vote for party leaders, allowing them to dominate its decision-making process, he added. </p><p> This perceived disadvantage of Mr Hou is being balanced out by the rest of the KMT\u2019s slate, said Dr Chen. </p><p> Mr Hou\u2019s running mate is television personality Jaw Shaw-kong, 73, while the party\u2019s top pick for legislator-at-large \u2013 who could become speaker if the KMT wins a legislative majority \u2013 is former Kaohsiung mayor Han Kuo-yu. </p><p> Both Mr Jaw and Mr Han are popular with mainlander voters as they are considered \u201cdeep blue\u201d, pro-China figures. </p><p> This election cycle also saw the identity issue intertwined with nationality, following speculation about the nationalities, and hence loyalties, of two vice-presidential candidates \u2013 Ms Hsiao Bi-khim of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and Ms Cynthia Wu of the Taiwan People\u2019s Party (TPP). </p><p> Ms Hsiao, 52, was born in Japan to a Taiwanese father and American mother. She grew up in Tainan, went to college in the United States, and served as Taiwan\u2019s representative to the US until she stepped down to contest the election. </p><p> Ms Wu, 45, was born in the United States to Taiwanese parents, and has studied in Taiwan, the US and the United Kingdom. She worked as an investment analyst in London before returning to Taipei to work for her family business, the Shin Kong Group, and became a legislator in 2022. </p><p> Dual nationals are barred from running for president or vice-president under Taiwanese law. In early December, Ms Hsiao and Ms Wu\u2019s nationalities became fodder for online speculation, with rumours that both candidates still held US citizenship. </p><p> Both Ms Hsiao and Ms Wu had their nationalities verified by the Central Election Commission, which deemed them eligible to run in early December. The non-profit Taiwan FactCheck Center also came out to debunk the rumours. </p><p> Dr Chen said the nationality controversy has been an exception in this election, compared to the past where the question of national identity is not openly discussed in such terms. </p>",

I could see signs of that happening in e-commerce, and really did not want to miss another revolution,\u201d she shared, explaining that she was too green at the time to make her mark in the sector.\nShe's certainly had the latitude to create an impact in retail, though. The veteran marketer has been credited for reviving the growth of Jabong, a fashion and lifestyle portal acquired by Myntra.\nFashion isn't a billboard obvious choice of sector for the computer science graduate, who doesn't profess to be sartorially inclined. Her wardrobe is decidedly understated \u2013 classic shapes and colours such as black and red are staples \u2013 while outside of work, her proclivities lie in the borderline geeky realm of sci-fi cinematic universes and sudoko puzzles.\nThough entrenched gender disparity has been well documented across multiple industries, close to 45 per cent of Zalora's senior leaders are females. The company also comprises at least 30 nationalities.\n\u201cIt is really in the interest of leaders to nurture diversity, because research has proven that companies with more diverse workforces produce results that are 10 to 15 times better in terms of profitability,\u201d she explained. Helming the largely female and multicultural team behind popular Zalora modest wear labels Lubna and Zalia, is a Muslim woman.\nThe company is also chiselling out its share of other niches.

                            "text": "A  S COVID-19  has spread around the world, people have become grimly familiar with the death tolls that their governments publish each day. Unfortunately, the total number of fatalities caused by the pandemic  may be even higher  , for several reasons. First, the official statistics in many countries exclude victims who did not test positive for coronavirus before dying\u2014which can be a substantial majority in places with little capacity for testing. Second, hospitals and civil registries may not process death certificates for several days, or even weeks, which creates lags in the data. And third, the pandemic has made it harder for doctors to treat other conditions and discouraged people from going to hospital, which may have indirectly caused an increase in fatalities from diseases other than covid-19.\nOne way to account for these methodological problems is to use a simpler measure, known as \u201cexcess deaths\u201d: take the number of people who die from any cause in a given region and period, and then compare it with a historical baseline from recent years. We have used statistical models to create our baselines, by predicting the number of deaths each region would normally have recorded in 2020 and 2021.\nMany Western countries, and some nations and regions elsewhere, regularly publish data on mortality from all causes. The table below shows that, in most places, the number of excess deaths (compared with our baseline) is greater than the number of covid-19 fatalities officially recorded by the government. The full data for each country, as well as our underlying code, can be downloaded from our  GitHub repository  . Our sources also include the  Human Mortality Database  , a collaboration between UC Berkeley and the Max Planck Institute in Germany, and the  World Mortality Dataset  , created by Ariel Karlinsky and Dmitry Kobak.\nThe chart below uses data from  EuroMOMO  , a network of epidemiologists who collect weekly reports on deaths from all causes in 23 European countries. These figures show that, compared with a historical baseline of the previous five years, Europe has suffered some deadly flu seasons since 2016\u2014but that the death toll from covid-19 has been far greater. Though most of those victims have been older than 65, the number of deaths among Europeans aged 45-64 was 40% higher than usual in early April 2020.\nBelow are a set of charts that compare the number of excess deaths and official covid-19 deaths over time in each country. The lines on each chart represent excess deaths, and the shaded area represents the number of fatalities officially attributed to coronavirus by the government.\nIn March 2020 America\u2019s east coast was hit hard by the pandemic. States elsewhere locked down quickly enough to prevent major outbreaks at that point, but a second wave in November and December surged through most of the country. Excess mortality was low from March 2021 onwards, as a rapid vaccination campaign allowed the country to open up again.\nWhile covid-19 was devastating New York in March 2020, cities in western Europe were also suffering severe outbreaks. Britain, Spain, Italy, Belgium and Portugal have some of the highest national excess-mortality rates in the world, after adjusting for the size of their populations. These countries also suffered a second wave of deaths in the autumn and winter of 2020. Some western European countries were slow to vaccinate their citizens in early 2021, as shown by  our covid-19 data tracker  . But by June mortality rates had returned to normal across the region.\nCountries in northern Europe have generally experienced much lower mortality rates throughout the pandemic. Some Nordic nations have experienced almost no excess deaths at all. The exception is Sweden, which imposed some of the continent\u2019s least restrictive social-distancing measures during the first wave.\nIn central Europe only the Netherlands and Switzerland suffered large numbers of excess deaths in early 2020. After international travel resumed, the entire region was ravaged in the autumn. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic all endured additional spikes of mortality in March and April 2021.\nSouth-eastern Europe has followed a similar pattern. November and December 2020 were particularly lethal, with Bulgaria recording the highest weekly excess-mortality rates of any country in our tracker. Several countries have since experienced further deadly outbreaks.\nAmong former republics of the Soviet Union, only Belarus suffered substantial excess mortality in early 2020, after introducing almost no constraints on daily life. A second wave in late 2020 affected the entire region. Russia now has one of the world\u2019s largest excess-mortality gaps. It recorded about 580,000 more deaths than expected between April 2020 and June 2021, compared with an official covid-19 toll of only 130,000.\nMuch of Latin America experienced a devastating first wave from April to July 2020, with Bolivia and Ecuador hit particularly hard. A second wave surged through the region in late 2020, as Mexico, Peru and Brazil all recorded higher peaks of excess mortality than at any previous point during the pandemic. The virus has continued to circulate throughout the continent since then, with Colombia and Paraguay suffering their worst death tolls in April and May 2021.\nOutside Europe and the Americas, few places release data about excess deaths. No such information exists for large swathes of Africa and Asia, where some countries only issue death certificates for a small fraction of people. For these places without national mortality data, The Economist has produced  estimates of excess deaths  using statistical models trained on the data in this tracker (as explained in our  methodology post  ). In India, for example, our estimates suggest that perhaps 2.3m people had died from covid-19 by the start of May 2021, compared with about 200,000 official deaths.\nAmong developing countries that do produce regular mortality statistics, South Africa shows the grimmest picture, after recording three large spikes of fatalities. In contrast, Malaysia and the Philippines had \u201cnegative\u201d excess mortality\u2014fewer deaths than they would normally have recorded, perhaps because of social distancing.\nA handful of rich countries elsewhere publish regular mortality data. They tend to have negative excess mortality. Australia and New Zealand managed to eradicate local transmission after severe lockdowns. Taiwan and South Korea achieved the same outcome through highly effective contact-tracing systems. Israel has experienced some excess deaths, but has also outpaced the rest of the world in vaccinating its population, with promising results.\nUpdate (October 14th 2020):  A previous version of this page used a five-year average of deaths in a given region to calculate a baseline for excess deaths. The page now uses a statistical model for each region, which predicts the number of deaths we might normally have expected in 2020. The model fits a linear trend to years, to adjust from long-term increases or decreases in deaths, and a fixed effect for each week or month.\nCorrection:  The data for deaths officially attributed to covid-19 in Chile were corrected on September 9th 2020. Apologies for this error.\nSources:  The Economist  ; Our World In Data; Johns Hopkins University; Human Mortality Database; World Mortality Dataset; Registro Civil (Bolivia); Vital Strategies; Office for National Statistics; Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency; National Records of Scotland; Registro Civil (Chile); Registro Civil (Ecuador); Institut National de la Statistique et des \u00c9tudes \u00c9conomiques; Sant\u00e9 Publique France; Provinsi DKI Jakarta; Istituto Nazionale di Statistica; Dipartimento della Protezione Civile; Secretar\u00eda de Salud (Mexico); Ministerio de Salud (Peru); Data Science Research Peru; Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estad\u00edstica (Colombia); South African Medical Research Council; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; Ministerio de Sanidad (Spain); Datadista; Istanbul Buyuksehir Belediyesi; Centres for Disease Control and Prevention; USA Facts; New York City Health.

Though most of those victims have been older than 65, the number of deaths among Europeans aged 45-64 was 40% higher than usual in early April 2020. </p><iframe src=\"https://www.economist.com/assets/infographic/2021/covid-19-excess-deaths-interactive/heatmap-euromomo.html\"></iframe><p> Below are a set of charts that compare the number of excess deaths and official covid-19 deaths over time in each country. The lines on each chart represent excess deaths, and the shaded area represents the number of fatalities officially attributed to coronavirus by the government. </p><iframe src=\"https://infographics.economist.com/2020/covid-19-excess-mortality-interactive-explainer/index.html\"></iframe><p> In March 2020 America\u2019s east coast was hit hard by the pandemic. States elsewhere locked down quickly enough to prevent major outbreaks at that point, but a second wave in November and December surged through most of the country. Excess mortality was low from March 2021 onwards, as a rapid vaccination campaign allowed the country to open up again. </p><iframe src=\"https://www.economist.com/assets/infographic/2021/covid-19-excess-deaths-interactive/line-expected-deaths-us.html\"></iframe><p> While covid-19 was devastating New York in March 2020, cities in western Europe were also suffering severe outbreaks. Britain, Spain, Italy, Belgium and Portugal have some of the highest national excess-mortality rates in the world, after adjusting for the size of their populations. These countries also suffered a second wave of deaths in the autumn and winter of 2020. Some western European countries were slow to vaccinate their citizens in early 2021, as shown by <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/tracking-coronavirus-across-the-world\"> our covid-19 data tracker </a> . But by June mortality rates had returned to normal across the region. </p><iframe src=\"https://www.economist.com/assets/infographic/2021/covid-19-excess-deaths-interactive/line-expected-deaths.html?countries=belgium;britain;spain;portugal;italy;france;ireland\"></iframe><p> Countries in northern Europe have generally experienced much lower mortality rates throughout the pandemic. Some Nordic nations have experienced almost no excess deaths at all. The exception is Sweden, which imposed some of the continent\u2019s least restrictive social-distancing measures during the first wave. </p><iframe src=\"https://www.economist.com/assets/infographic/2021/covid-19-excess-deaths-interactive/line-expected-deaths.html?countries=sweden;estonia;denmark;finland;norway;iceland\"></iframe><p> In central Europe only the Netherlands and Switzerland suffered large numbers of excess deaths in early 2020. After international travel resumed, the entire region was ravaged in the autumn. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic all endured additional spikes of mortality in March and April 2021. </p><iframe src=\"https://www.economist.com/assets/infographic/2021/covid-19-excess-deaths-interactive/line-expected-deaths.html?countries=poland;czech-republic;slovenia;hungary;netherlands;austria;switzerland;germany;slovakia;luxembourg\"></iframe><p> South-eastern Europe has followed a similar pattern. November and December 2020 were particularly lethal, with Bulgaria recording the highest weekly excess-mortality rates of any country in our tracker. Several countries have since experienced further deadly outbreaks. </p><iframe src=\"https://www.economist.com/assets/infographic/2021/covid-19-excess-deaths-interactive/line-expected-deaths.html?countries=bulgaria;serbia;north-macedonia;romania;kosovo;croatia;bosnia-and-herzegovina;albania;malta;greece;montenegro\"></iframe><p> Among former republics of the Soviet Union, only Belarus suffered substantial excess mortality in early 2020, after introducing almost no constraints on daily life. A second wave in late 2020 affected the entire region. Russia now has one of the world\u2019s largest excess-mortality gaps. It recorded about 580,000 more deaths than expected between April 2020 and June 2021, compared with an official covid-19 toll of only 130,000. </p><iframe src=\"https://www.economist.com/assets/infographic/2021/covid-19-excess-deaths-interactive/line-expected-deaths.html?countries=russia;lithuania;moldova;kyrgyzstan;latvia;ukraine;belarus;uzbekistan;georgia;kazakhstan;tajikistan\"></iframe><p> Much of Latin America experienced a devastating first wave from April to July 2020, with Bolivia and Ecuador hit particularly hard. A second wave surged through the region in late 2020, as Mexico, Peru and Brazil all recorded higher peaks of excess mortality than at any previous point during the pandemic. The virus has continued to circulate throughout the continent since then, with Colombia and Paraguay suffering their worst death tolls in April and May 2021. </p><iframe src=\"https://www.economist.com/assets/infographic/2021/covid-19-excess-deaths-interactive/line-expected-deaths.html?countries=peru;mexico;bolivia;ecuador;brazil;chile;colombia;costa-rica;el-salvador;nicaragua;panama;paraguay;cuba;uruguay;guatemala;argentina\"></iframe><p> Outside Europe and the Americas, few places release data about excess deaths. No such information exists for large swathes of Africa and Asia, where some countries only issue death certificates for a small fraction of people. For these places without national mortality data, The Economist has produced <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/briefing/2021/05/15/there-have-been-7m-13m-excess-deaths-worldwide-during-the-pandemic\"> estimates of excess deaths </a> using statistical models trained on the data in this tracker (as explained in our <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/05/13/how-we-estimated-the-true-death-toll-of-the-pandemic\"> methodology post </a> ). In India, for example, our estimates suggest that perhaps 2.3m people had died from covid-19 by the start of May 2021, compared with about 200,000 official deaths. </p><p> Among developing countries that do produce regular mortality statistics, South Africa shows the grimmest picture, after recording three large spikes of fatalities. In contrast, Malaysia and the Philippines had \u201cnegative\u201d excess mortality\u2014fewer deaths than they would normally have recorded, perhaps because of social distancing. </p><iframe src=\"https://www.economist.com/assets/infographic/2021/covid-19-excess-deaths-interactive/line-expected-deaths.html?countries=south-africa;egypt;oman;thailand;philippines;mongolia;iran;jamaica;malaysia;mauritius;lebanon\"></iframe><p> A handful of rich countries elsewhere publish regular mortality data. They tend to have negative excess mortality. Australia and New Zealand managed to eradicate local transmission after severe lockdowns. Taiwan and South Korea achieved the same outcome through highly effective contact-tracing systems. Israel has experienced some excess deaths, but has also outpaced the rest of the world in vaccinating its population, with promising results. </p><iframe src=\"https://www.economist.com/assets/infographic/2021/covid-19-excess-deaths-interactive/line-expected-deaths.html?countries=israel;canada;qatar;cyprus;south-korea;singapore;japan;australia;taiwan;new-zealand;hong-kong\"></iframe><p><i><b> Update (October 14th 2020): </b> A previous version of this page used a five-year average of deaths in a given region to calculate a baseline for excess deaths.

She pointed out that with a population of 93 million, Vietnam was Southeast Asia\u2019s third most populous country after Indonesia and the Philippines, noting that 15 to 24-year-old account for about one-fourth of the population. \u201cVietnam\u2019s workforce is not just young, but skilled and hardworking,\u201d said Vu. \u201cVietnam\u2019s labour costs are among the lowest in Asia\u201d, added Vu, \u201cthis is proving attractive for companies looking to set up business in the country. A burgeoning urban middle class is driving changes in consumption patterns and creating new domestic markets\u201d, Vu added.\nVu also highlighted the close land and sea connections China and Vietnam shared, and pointed out that Vietnam was the nearest country to the manufacturing heartland of southern China. A significant number of Chinese-operated lower-cost manufacturing enterprises had set up businesses in Vietnam to take advantage of low labour costs, she said. Along Vietnam's coastline, Vu said seaports and dock facilities were being modernised. Vietnam is also upgrading facilities at its international and domestic airport facilities.\nVu noted that improved infrastructure and transport links were expected to help develop Vietnam\u2019s own industrial base. Meanwhile, the deputy consul general said special economic zones were being established to support business-friendly polices Vietnam has put in place to attract investment across a range of industry sectors.\nAdvertisement\n\nIncentives included lower corporate income tax (CIT), tax reductions or exemptions, land-rent reduction and import-duty exemption for eligible projects. Priority was being given to sectors including infrastructure projects, manufacturing of high-tech products such as biotechnology, IT and mechanical engineering, research and development, and education and training.\nIntroducing her presentation with a brief history of the fabled Silk Road trading routes, Christine Ip, United Overseas Bank (UOB) CEO of Greater China, said the business and investment opportunities for Vietnam due to One Belt, One Road initiatives shared similarities with China\u2019s economic opening in the late 1970s. Ip recalled that when she was studying for her MBA at the HKUST, she found it was such an exciting period, because things were happening on a scope and scale with little precedent in modern history.\nDaily, Monday to Friday\n\nChina at a Glance Newsletter\n\nYour daily must-read of essential stories from China, including politics, economy and current affairs.\n\nBy submitting, you consent to receiving marketing emails from SCMP. If you don't want these, tick here\n\nBy registering, you agree to our  T&C  and  Privacy Policy\n\nVietnam\u2019s early One Belt, One Road-related investment opportunities included energy resources and government-led infrastructure projects. Ip expected the next phase of investment opportunities to include technology, media and telecommunication (TMT), and real estate. \u201cHong Kong, as an international financial centre and global offshore Renminbi business hub, is in a strong position to facilitate services for raising the capital needed to fund Vietnam\u2019s Road projects, as well as those of others,\u201d noted Ip.\nDavid Chao, head of the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Advisory Unit at UOB Hong Kong, was equally optimistic. Chao emphasised the importance of the Vietnam-ASEAN network, and said it would strengthen the connectivity of One Belt, One Road initiatives. \u201cVietnam has some of the most extensive trade relations and connectivity with other members of the ASEAN community,\u201d noted Chao, who also explained how foreign investment was laying the foundation for Vietnam to become Southeast Asia\u2019s next major centre for electronics manufacturing.\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA major Korean electronics company has recently increased its investment in Vietnam from USD2.5billion to USD2.61billion in the first quarter of 2017, making it one of the nation\u2019s largest FDI investors and also private employers. It is testament to the company\u2019s confidence in the Vietnam government and economy,\u201d Chao said. Vietnam\u2019s strategic geographic position, its political stability and its openness to trade, underpin the appeal of the Vietnamese market for investors. \u201cI am optimistic Hong Kong can provide the platform and professional services to facilitate One Belt, One Road investments into and out of Vietnam,\u201d said Chao, who also highlighted how UOB had advised and helped client companies establish businesses in Vietnam.\nDickson Ho, principal economist (Asian and emerging markets) at the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, pointed out that Hong Kong and Vietnam shared well-established trade links. Ho said Hong Kong\u2019s status as a regional trading hub, its experience of providing logistics and maritime services, its ability to finance and build large-scale infrastructure projects and East-meets-West business, along with its language knowledge, were competitive tools with which to take advantage of One Belt, One Road opportunities. \u201cHong Kong\u2019s super-connector capabilities are enhanced, because we are within five hours\u2019 flight time to the majority of the countries along the 21st-century Silk Road,\u201d noted Ho.",

Priority was being given to sectors including infrastructure projects, manufacturing of high-tech products such as biotechnology, IT and mechanical engineering, research and development, and education and training. </p><p> Introducing her presentation with a brief history of the fabled Silk Road trading routes, Christine Ip, United Overseas Bank (UOB) CEO of Greater China, said the business and investment opportunities for Vietnam due to One Belt, One Road initiatives shared similarities with China\u2019s economic opening in the late 1970s. Ip recalled that when she was studying for her MBA at the HKUST, she found it was such an exciting period, because things were happening on a scope and scale with little precedent in modern history. </p><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div> Daily, Monday to Friday </div></div><div><div> China at a Glance Newsletter </div></div><div><div> Your daily must-read of essential stories from China, including politics, economy and current affairs. </div></div><div><div> By submitting, you consent to receiving marketing emails from SCMP.

It is testament to the company\u2019s confidence in the Vietnam government and economy,\u201d Chao said. Vietnam\u2019s strategic geographic position, its political stability and its openness to trade, underpin the appeal of the Vietnamese market for investors. \u201cI am optimistic Hong Kong can provide the platform and professional services to facilitate One Belt, One Road investments into and out of Vietnam,\u201d said Chao, who also highlighted how UOB had advised and helped client companies establish businesses in Vietnam. </p><p> Dickson Ho, principal economist (Asian and emerging markets) at the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, pointed out that Hong Kong and Vietnam shared well-established trade links.

                            "text": "In order to better inform our understanding of the implementation of the BRI based on evidence rather than rhetoric, I recently led research teams to complete two major projects on the BRI\u2014one on \u201cTrade and Investment Under the Belt and Road and Implications for Hong Kong\u201d supported by Hong Kong\u2019s Strategic Public Policy Research Scheme, and another on \u201cThe Belt and Road Initiative in ASEAN\u201d, a collaboration between HKUST\u2019s Institute for Emerging Market Studies and United Overseas Bank. These projects and related research have produced quantitative and qualitative findings that inform the questions just posed. Quantitative analysis utilizes micro-data on Chinese outbound FDI and construction projects in all countries from 2010 to 2019.\nFirst, analysis of the project-level data finds that the BRI significantly increased Chinese investments in BRI countries (defined as the originally targeted 67 countries). Both FDI and construction projects increased by more than 50% in BRI countries after the Initiative began compared to changes in non-BRI countries. When we analyze the determinants of the flow of Chinese FDI to different countries before and after the Initiative began, we find that compared to the years before the BRI (2010-2013), since the BRI began the importance of economic fundamentals (such as GDP growth rates) has declined, while the importance of the countries\u2019 governance quality (including measures of political stability, corruption, rule of law, regulatory quality, and government effectiveness) has increased. These findings suggest that outbound FDI flows are less profit-motivated under the BRI, raising concerns about their economic viability. At the same time, the greater importance of governance factors contradicts the narrative that China is seeking to exploit corrupt, poorly governed countries. Encouraged to make investments in BRI countries, many Chinese companies apparently seek to avoid countries with high governance risk. We find that this is true for investments by both state-owned firms and private firms.\nWhat has been the impact of the BRI on international trade? A recent paper by Amber Yao LI, Associate Professor in the Department of Economics, and co-authors finds that the BRI significantly increases bilateral trade flows between BRI countries. The Initiative also increases the total trade volume of BRI countries, especially imports. With respect to trade with China, China\u2019s imports from BRI countries increases after the Initiative, while exports from China to BRI countries do not change appreciably. These findings are consistent with China using FDI in BRI countries to secure access to resources (e.g., energy, minerals) or to outsource production of goods sold in China. The finding of positive trade impacts is important for two reasons. First, much research in economics has found a strong link between trade and growth. Second, if the BRI expands trade with member countries, it may have the potential to counter the trend towards deglobalization.\nDiplomatic and economic objectives\nSince China\u2019s objectives for the BRI are diplomatic as well as economic, it is of interest to ask whether the Initiative has increased China\u2019s soft power. To shed light on this question, in an ongoing project with coauthors, I examine how sentiment towards China in different countries has been affected by the Initiative. Machine learning methods are used to analyze the positive or negative sentiment found in over one million media articles about China published globally from 2013 to 2019. We find that in most parts of the world, sentiment towards China has become increasingly negative in recent years. This is even true in countries receiving the most FDI from China under the BRI (Indonesia, Pakistan, Russia). Further analysis finds that sentiment towards China is inversely related to the amount of FDI or construction projects received from China. This negative correlation is more apparent when the FDI projects are in the resource sector, and when they are made by state-owned enterprises. Thus, China does not appear to be increasing its soft power through the BRI and may even be harming it.\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy would more Chinese investment in a country increase negative sentiment towards China even though there is evidence that the investments are having positive development impacts? Qualitative research in countries in Southeast Asia as well as other parts of the world finds that some Chinese projects are very unpopular locally because they harm the environment or have poor labor relations (for example, fail to obey local labor regulations or customary practices, or hire Chinese rather than local workers, etc.). Even one bad project in a country can attract considerable media attention and severely damage the reputation of Chinese firms. Opposition politicians may mobilize support by criticizing China or the close relationship between government leaders and China. China has drawn criticism from climate activists for being the only international donor that continues to finance coal energy projects. In many instances, China has funded projects requested by government leaders without doing sufficient due diligence to assess environmental and social impacts or to reach out to local communities. Some Chinese companies are gradually learning from their mistakes, by funding more renewable energy projects and focusing more on corporate social responsibility. A main conclusion from these findings is that if the BRI is to realize its lofty objectives, China would be well-advised to put greater priority on ensuring that Belt and Road projects meet high standards with respect to both economic viability and environmental and social impacts. The record of Western foreign aid programs to the developing world shows convincingly that money does not buy development.\nA commitment to finish\nHow has deglobalization due to the US-China trade war and the pandemic affected the implementation of the BRI? A bilateral trade war naturally diverts economic activity to third party countries which actually could increase investment incentives in BRI countries. For example, Chinese companies and multinationals who manufacture goods in China and export them to the US have an incentive to relocate production from China to other countries to avoid punitive tariffs and diversify risk exposure. Producers in BRI countries may have greater opportunities to export to both China and the US. At the same time, if the trade conflict slows growth in the world\u2019s two largest economies or spreads protectionism to other countries, this could have a chilling effect on foreign investment and trade globally. In this light, the recent signing of the world\u2019s largest trade pact, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) signed by all ASEAN countries, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, demonstrates that countries in East Asia are committed to expanding rather reducing economic integration efforts. The agreement is complementary to the Belt and Road Initiative in that it facilitates globalization of supply chains and increases the benefits of trade and foreign investment.\nDaily, Monday to Friday\n\nChina at a Glance Newsletter\n\nYour daily must-read of essential stories from China, including politics, economy and current affairs.\n\nBy submitting, you consent to receiving marketing emails from SCMP. If you don't want these, tick here\n\nBy registering, you agree to our  T&C  and  Privacy Policy\n\nSimilarly, the leaders of most BRI countries have reaffirmed their commitment to completing major Belt and Road projects even if they are delayed due to the pandemic. Most infrastructure and investment projects were delayed by at least three to six months due to disruption caused by lockdowns, travel bans, and the preoccupation of government leaders and firm managers with responding to the crisis. The pandemic was a major economic shock to nearly all countries, even those that did a good job controlling the outbreak. This led many governments to re-prioritise spending commitments, which led to the cancellation of some BRI projects. On the other hand, some governments with sufficient resources, such as the Philippines, decided to increase infrastructure spending as a way to stimulate their economies. Many economies, including the US and China, are bouncing back strongly in 2021.\nTo sum up, China\u2019s ambitious effort to promote greater connectivity with other countries through the BRI has created new infrastructure, increased investment, and expanded trade in BRI countries, but also has encountered criticisms that have undermined the Initiative\u2019s ability to win hearts and minds in BRI countries. Nonetheless, the BRI is not going away any time soon. The recent turn towards deglobalization and growing anti-China sentiment create a challenging environment for the Initiative, but leaders in China and in most BRI countries remain committed to pursuing greater economic integration even as they adjust to a more confrontational and competitive relationship between the world two largest economies.\nMedia Sentiment Towards China in Belt and Road Countries Receiving the Most Chinese Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), 2013-2019\n\nReference\nHKUST Institute for Emerging Market Studies and United Overseas Bank (2020).

                            "html": "<p> In order to better inform our understanding of the implementation of the BRI based on evidence rather than rhetoric, I recently led research teams to complete two major projects on the BRI\u2014one on \u201cTrade and Investment Under the Belt and Road and Implications for Hong Kong\u201d supported by Hong Kong\u2019s Strategic Public Policy Research Scheme, and another on \u201cThe Belt and Road Initiative in ASEAN\u201d, a collaboration between HKUST\u2019s Institute for Emerging Market Studies and United Overseas Bank. These projects and related research have produced quantitative and qualitative findings that inform the questions just posed. Quantitative analysis utilizes micro-data on Chinese outbound FDI and construction projects in all countries from 2010 to 2019. </p><section><p> First, analysis of the project-level data finds that the BRI significantly increased Chinese investments in BRI countries (defined as the originally targeted 67 countries). Both FDI and construction projects increased by more than 50% in BRI countries after the Initiative began compared to changes in non-BRI countries. When we analyze the determinants of the flow of Chinese FDI to different countries before and after the Initiative began, we find that compared to the years before the BRI (2010-2013), since the BRI began the importance of economic fundamentals (such as GDP growth rates) has declined, while the importance of the countries\u2019 governance quality (including measures of political stability, corruption, rule of law, regulatory quality, and government effectiveness) has increased. These findings suggest that outbound FDI flows are less profit-motivated under the BRI, raising concerns about their economic viability. At the same time, the greater importance of governance factors contradicts the narrative that China is seeking to exploit corrupt, poorly governed countries. Encouraged to make investments in BRI countries, many Chinese companies apparently seek to avoid countries with high governance risk. We find that this is true for investments by both state-owned firms and private firms. </p><p> What has been the impact of the BRI on international trade? A recent paper by Amber Yao LI, Associate Professor in the Department of Economics, and co-authors finds that the BRI significantly increases bilateral trade flows between BRI countries. The Initiative also increases the total trade volume of BRI countries, especially imports. With respect to trade with China, China\u2019s imports from BRI countries increases after the Initiative, while exports from China to BRI countries do not change appreciably. These findings are consistent with China using FDI in BRI countries to secure access to resources (e.g., energy, minerals) or to outsource production of goods sold in China. The finding of positive trade impacts is important for two reasons. First, much research in economics has found a strong link between trade and growth. Second, if the BRI expands trade with member countries, it may have the potential to counter the trend towards deglobalization. </p><p><strong data-qa=\"ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0\" class=\"css-1mniedq eq9i94316\"> Diplomatic and economic objectives </strong></p><p> Since China\u2019s objectives for the BRI are diplomatic as well as economic, it is of interest to ask whether the Initiative has increased China\u2019s soft power. To shed light on this question, in an ongoing project with coauthors, I examine how sentiment towards China in different countries has been affected by the Initiative. Machine learning methods are used to analyze the positive or negative sentiment found in over one million media articles about China published globally from 2013 to 2019. We find that in most parts of the world, sentiment towards China has become increasingly negative in recent years. This is even true in countries receiving the most FDI from China under the BRI (Indonesia, Pakistan, Russia). Further analysis finds that sentiment towards China is inversely related to the amount of FDI or construction projects received from China. This negative correlation is more apparent when the FDI projects are in the resource sector, and when they are made by state-owned enterprises. Thus, China does not appear to be increasing its soft power through the BRI and may even be harming it. </p><div><div><div> Advertisement </div></div></div><p> Why would more Chinese investment in a country increase negative sentiment towards China even though there is evidence that the investments are having positive development impacts? Qualitative research in countries in Southeast Asia as well as other parts of the world finds that some Chinese projects are very unpopular locally because they harm the environment or have poor labor relations (for example, fail to obey local labor regulations or customary practices, or hire Chinese rather than local workers, etc.). Even one bad project in a country can attract considerable media attention and severely damage the reputation of Chinese firms. Opposition politicians may mobilize support by criticizing China or the close relationship between government leaders and China. China has drawn criticism from climate activists for being the only international donor that continues to finance coal energy projects. In many instances, China has funded projects requested by government leaders without doing sufficient due diligence to assess environmental and social impacts or to reach out to local communities. Some Chinese companies are gradually learning from their mistakes, by funding more renewable energy projects and focusing more on corporate social responsibility. A main conclusion from these findings is that if the BRI is to realize its lofty objectives, China would be well-advised to put greater priority on ensuring that Belt and Road projects meet high standards with respect to both economic viability and environmental and social impacts. The record of Western foreign aid programs to the developing world shows convincingly that money does not buy development. </p><p><strong data-qa=\"ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0\" class=\"css-1mniedq eq9i94316\"> A commitment to finish </strong></p><p> How has deglobalization due to the US-China trade war and the pandemic affected the implementation of the BRI? A bilateral trade war naturally diverts economic activity to third party countries which actually could increase investment incentives in BRI countries. For example, Chinese companies and multinationals who manufacture goods in China and export them to the US have an incentive to relocate production from China to other countries to avoid punitive tariffs and diversify risk exposure. Producers in BRI countries may have greater opportunities to export to both China and the US. At the same time, if the trade conflict slows growth in the world\u2019s two largest economies or spreads protectionism to other countries, this could have a chilling effect on foreign investment and trade globally. In this light, the recent signing of the world\u2019s largest trade pact, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) signed by all ASEAN countries, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, demonstrates that countries in East Asia are committed to expanding rather reducing economic integration efforts. The agreement is complementary to the Belt and Road Initiative in that it facilitates globalization of supply chains and increases the benefits of trade and foreign investment. </p><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div> Daily, Monday to Friday </div></div><div><div> China at a Glance Newsletter </div></div><div><div> Your daily must-read of essential stories from China, including politics, economy and current affairs. </div></div><div><div> By submitting, you consent to receiving marketing emails from SCMP.

The pandemic was a major economic shock to nearly all countries, even those that did a good job controlling the outbreak. This led many governments to re-prioritise spending commitments, which led to the cancellation of some BRI projects. On the other hand, some governments with sufficient resources, such as the Philippines, decided to increase infrastructure spending as a way to stimulate their economies.

It is the world\u2019s largest, and Lynas is now the largest processor of rare earths outside China.\n\nPower Scramble\n\nThink of your iPhone. Think of how compact it is.\u201d\n\nBut isolating neodymium from its mineral is when things get tricky. Rare earths tend to occur together \u2014 often, all 17 in the same ore \u2014 and as they are chemically similar, they are harder to process than other metals.\n\u201cWhat makes (them) so \u2018rare\u2019 is the complexity of extracting them,\u201d said Sahajwalla.\nWhile rare earth projects are spread across the world, China stands out, with 70 per cent of production last year. The US makes up 14 per cent, followed by Australia, Myanmar and other countries, US Geological Survey data showed.\nAnd even the US must export its rare earth raw materials to China before they can be used in the manufacture of magnets.\n\u201cThere are enough deposits in the world that can supply rare earths. But \u2026 the critical point is who controls the processing technologies,\u201d said Marina Yue Zhang, an associate professor at the Australia-China Relations Institute, University of Technology Sydney.\n\u201cChina is the only country in the world that\u2019s developed the capacity to cover the entire value chain of 17 rare earth elements. \u2026 China has developed the advantages in not just technology, but also waste management.\u201d\n\nWINDS OF CHANGE DRIVING DEMAND\nChina\u2019s domination of the rare earths supply chain does not stop at the processing but extends downstream. According to estimates, Chinese factories make as much as over 90 per cent of the high-strength rare earth magnets used in the world.\nBecause of this ready supply, many electronics makers, whether for foreign or domestic brands, have located their manufacturing plants in provinces like Guangdong. What then leaves China are the finished, \u201cMade in China\u201d products, from smartphones to earbuds and more.\n\u201cYou may be surprised to learn that electronic products account for less than 10 per cent of the total magnetic material applications,\u201d Beijing Magtech CEO Yoki Xu told Power Scramble.\n\u201cAmong other applications, the most important one is in automobiles. This part already accounts for more than 40 per cent. The next highest consumption is, for example, in energy-saving home appliances and some energy-saving lifts \u2026 and wind power generation.\n\u201cAnything that needs to move has a motor. \u2026 And rare earth magnets have this ability to improve the performance of motors and help them save energy. So this usage is rapidly increasing every year.\u201d\nWATCH: Inside a Chinese factory that makes the powerful magnets in our smartphones (4:08)\n\nThe plant near Kuantan has been processing rare earths for more than 10 years, which also involves processing radioactive materials contained in the ores. And the International Atomic Energy Agency has said Lynas meets all the requirements for radiation safety.\nBut Malaysian Nature Society (Pahang) chair Noor Jehan Abu Bakar is worried because a permanent disposal facility for low-level radioactive waste is being built only now, \u201cafter a lot of protests from the local community\u201d.\n\u201cThere\u2019s already been exposure for more than 10 years,\u201d she said. While there has been no evidence of people falling sick, she attributed her worries to \u201cwhat happened in Bukit Merah in the late 80s and 90s\u201d.\nLynas, however, says the comparisons are unscientific as the Bukit Merah residues had 50 times the radioactivity that Lynas residues have.\nChong, too, dismisses the idea that history will repeat itself in Kuantan. \u201cThis is an entirely different setting, and Lynas has proven itself to be strictly adhering to all the regulations in place,\u201d he said.\n\nOur concern is the lack of (regulation) and lack of compliance (with) environmental practice.\u201d\n\nBut there are also errant companies. There\u2019s land owned by the community, but because the company feels it has power, it just takes over the land.\u201d\n\nWill sustainability always be a priority, however, as demand grows? That is a question that will bear on the lives of more and more people in the region going forward.",

The long-term positive outlook has not changed,\u201d said a statement from the 24-member Politburo \u2013 the Communist Party\u2019s prime decision-making body.\nLooking forward, China\u2019s leadership has long focused on its development strategy to move away from economic growth targets and towards systemic resilience by calling for a drive for an \u201cinternal cycle\u201d in the five-year plan to 2025.\nIn his work report to the 20th party congress in October, Xi laid out the top priorities as emphasising \u201cgreen\u201d and \u201chigh-quality\u201d development, greater self-reliance and strength in science and technology, as well as improving mechanisms to promote a high-quality workforce and employment.\nChina previously included a goal to lift itself into a \u201chigh income\u201d nation by 2025 and advance to a \u201cmoderately developed\u201d nation by 2035, which implies income of more than US$20,000 per person.

With further structural reforms, it is not a problem in achieving a GDP growth of 4.5 to 5 per cent in the coming years, which would help us reach this target,\u201d said Yu, who is also a chair professor of economics at Peking University.\nBy 2035, China is also expected to become a \u201cmanufacturing superpower\u201d and a global leader in strategically important emerging industries.\nHowever, even China\u2019s traditional role as the world\u2019s leading manufacturer, exporter and top investment destination faces challenges as geopolitical tensions grow.\nThe US and its allies are calling to de-risk their supply chains away from China to reduce reliance, while the list of export controls against Chinese companies due to security concerns has been expanded.\nWhile China\u2019s trade with  neighbouring Southeast Asian countries  and developing economies has been growing, Mexico just replaced China for the first time since 2014 as the US\u2019 biggest trading partner.\n\nChina\u2019s\ninvestment\nFor foreign investors, China\u2019s newly introduced  anti-espionage law  has spurred foreign chambers of commerce to call for clarification, potentially adding more complications for companies considering moving out of China.\nAccording to a poll published by the European Chamber of Commerce in China in June, 46 per cent of 570 companies surveyed said their \u201cinvestments begin to shift out of China as de-risking strategies emerge\u201d.\nNeil Thomas, a Chinese politics fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute\u2019s Centre for China Analysis, said Xi faces a balancing act between economic growth and national security.\n\u201cXi can still grow the economy with statist and more security-focused policies, just not as much as if he leaned further into building more open and efficient markets,\u201d said Thomas.\n\u201cTo Xi Jinping, national security holds paramount importance over national and domestic security as it directly impacts his survival as a leader,\u201d said Lee.\nBut despite some analysts saying that Xi does not appear to be facing a crisis moment despite current challenges, China\u2019s competition with the US will now take place in direct comparison as its economic rebound has recovered better than expected.\nIn a closed-door economic academic seminar in July, Chinese economists said they were surprised to see the US recovery holding up.",

                            "text": "T  HE WORLD\u2019S  supply chains have taken a knock yet again. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine provoked the biggest commodity shock since 1973, and one of the worst disruptions to wheat supplies in a century. Countries from Hungary to Indonesia are banning food exports to ensure supply at home. The West has issued sanctions against Russia, depriving it of all sorts of parts and technologies.\nThe strain on globalisation comes on top of the effects of the financial crisis of 2007-09, Brexit, President Donald Trump and the pandemic. For years measures of global integration have gone south. Between 2008 and 2019 world trade, relative to global  GDP  , fell by about five percentage points. Tariffs and other barriers to trade are piling up. Global flows of long-term investment fell by half between 2016 and 2019. Immigration is lower too, and not just because of border closures.\nThe war in Ukraine stands to accelerate another profound shift in global trade flows, by pitting large autocracies against liberal democracies. Such confrontation happened during the cold war, too. But this time autocracies are bigger, richer and more technologically sophisticated. Their share in global output, trade and innovation has risen, and they are key links in many supply chains. Attempts to drift apart, therefore, will bring new consequences, and costs, for the world economy.\nAfter the second world war democracies ruled the economic roost. In 1960 America, Britain, Canada, France, Italy and Japan accounted for about 40% of global exports. Autocracies, by contrast, were economically unimportant on the world stage. The Soviet Union accounted for 4% of global trade; China barely featured in the statistics. Average  GDP  per head across the communist bloc was a tenth of America\u2019s. The West was locked in a fierce ideological battle with communist countries, filled with proxy wars and nuclear scares. But in economic terms there was no contest.\nTheir economies were also largely unintegrated. One observer in the late 1950s reckoned that trade between the  USSR  and America was so small that a big shipment could double the total from one month to another. The exceptions in east-west trade\u2014a bit of Russian gas to Europe; a wheat deal in 1972; a vodka-for-Pepsi swap from 1974\u2014were few. A study published by the  IMF  days before the Soviet Union fell said that \u201cforeign direct investment in the  USSR  has been minimal to date\u201d.\nThe communist bloc played by its own rules. Soviet external economic activity largely took place within  COMECON  , a group of sympathetic countries (China and the  USSR  barely traded with each other from the late 1950s, having fallen out). Trade in  COMECON  took place not via money-for-stuff, but in the form of a peculiar system of barter\u2014oil for manufactured goods, say\u2014agreed by governments.\nFrom the late 1970s onwards, autocratic regimes began to open up. In part this was the result of an ideological change, first apparent in China. The death of Chairman Mao in 1976 allowed hitherto heretical views to emerge. \u201cUnless it could expand and modernise its economy more rapidly than it had done in previous decades, China would remain poor, weak and vulnerable,\u201d wrote Aaron Friedberg of Princeton University in a paper published in 2018, describing the ideas of Deng Xiaoping, the leader who spearheaded China\u2019s opening up in the 1980s. A focus on class struggle gave way to a desire for modernisation and development. Further momentum for globalisation came from the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.\nThe West, on the whole, welcomed and encouraged economic liberalisation, believing that it could be a force for good (and for large profits). By bringing countries into the global trading system it would be possible to raise living standards, as well as foster democracy and freedom. A globalised world would also be a more peaceful one, the argument went.\nIn the 1990s globalisation took off. Trade boomed. Annual global flows of foreign direct investment (  FDI  , including purchases of companies and the construction of new factories) rose by a factor of six. In 1990 Russia\u2019s first McDonald\u2019s opened, in Moscow;  KFC  set up shop a few years later. Russian oil companies began directing their exports towards the West. Between 1985 and 2015 Chinese goods exports to America rose by a factor of 125.\nLiving standards certainly went up. The number of people living in extreme poverty has fallen by 60% since 1990. Some formerly closed countries have utterly changed. The average Estonian is now only marginally poorer than the average Italian.\nThe other hoped-for benefit of globalisation\u2014political liberalisation\u2014has faltered, however. Our World in Data, a research organisation, puts countries into four groups, ranging from most to least free: \u201cliberal democracies\u201d, such as America and Japan; more flawed \u201celectoral democracies\u201d, such as Poland and Sri Lanka; \u201celectoral autocracies\u201d, such as Turkey and Hungary; and \u201cclosed autocracies\u201d, such as China and Vietnam, where citizens have no real choice over their leader.\nClassifying political regimes is not an exact science, and involves making assumptions and judgments. Our World In Data counts India as an electoral autocracy since 2019, for instance, which some other sources do not agree with. Nonetheless, it helps give an idea of a broader trend: the waning might of liberal democracies.\nThe share of political regimes that were liberal democracies rose from 11% in 1970 to 23% in 2010. But democracy has retrenched since. Most of the 1.9bn people living in closed autocracies now reside in just one country: China. But lesser forms of autocracy are on the rise, such as in Turkey, where President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has consolidated power during his two decades in office (see chart 1).\nUsing data from the World Bank, the  IMF  and elsewhere, we divide the global economy into two. We estimate that today the autocratic world (ie, closed and electoral autocracies) accounts for over 30% of global  GDP  , more than double its share at the end of the cold war. Its share of global exports has soared over that period. The combined market value of its listed firms represented just 3% of the global total in 1989. Now it represents 30% (see chart 2).\nChina is by far the biggest non-democracy in economic terms, with a dollar  GDP  roughly two-thirds of America\u2019s, making up over half of our group of autocracies. But others, such as Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Vietnam, have also gained in economic clout over the past 30 years.\nAutocracies are now an especially serious rival to democracies when it comes to investment and innovation. In 2020 their governments and firms invested $9trn in everything from machinery and equipment to the construction of roads and railways. Democracies invested $12trn. Autocracies received more  FDI  than democracies between 2018 and 2020. And since the mid-1990s their share of patent applications has gone from 5% to over 60%. China dominates patenting, but on almost all our other measures the economic power of autocracies has soared even after China is excluded from our calculations.\nMany autocracies have remained steadfastly mercantilist. China, for instance, opened its domestic markets where it suited it, but kept whole sectors closed off to allow domestic champions to rise. Nonetheless autocracies have become integrated with democracies to an extent that would have been unthinkable during the cold war. Vietnam, which has been ruled by a single party for decades, for instance, has become a pivotal link in the global manufacturing supply chain. The kingdoms and emirates of the Middle East are vital sources of oil and gas.\nWe estimate that roughly one-third of democracies\u2019 goods imports come from other political regimes. The codependency in some markets is clear. Democracies produce about two-thirds of the oil necessary to meet their daily needs. The rest must come from somewhere else. Half of the coffee that fills Europeans\u2019 cups comes from places where people have weak political rights. And that is before getting to precious metals and rare earths.\nIntegration goes far beyond trade. American multinationals employ 3m people outside democracies, a rise of 90% in the past decade (their total foreign employment has increased by a third). Investors from democracies hold over a third of the autocratic world\u2019s total stock of inward  FDI  . Autocracies have built up huge foreign reserves, now worth more than $7trn and often denominated in \u201cfree\u201d currencies like the dollar and the euro.\n\nBROKEN DREAM\nThis intimacy is now under threat as a third, darker period comes into view. Even before the war in Ukraine, powerful countries were losing interest in a truly global presence. Instead they were seeking to rely more on themselves or to dominate their immediate geographical area. Their new thinking is becoming increasingly enshrined in strategy and policy.\nThe waning appetite for globalisation has a few causes. One relates to greater consumer awareness in the West about human-rights abuses in places such as China and Vietnam. Polls in Western countries regularly find that a high share of respondents support boycotting Chinese goods (whether they would actually do so is another matter). Western companies are being pressed to source goods elsewhere. Concerns over the national-security implications of trade and investment, including industrial espionage, have also risen.\nAutocracies have their own worries. One is that too much integration can cause Western culture to seep across borders, weakening autocratic rule. Deng himself identified the dilemma: \u201cIf you open the window for fresh air, you have to expect some flies to blow in.\u201d\nAnother, bigger worry relates to power. Being part of global supply chains means being vulnerable to sanctions. This was clear from an early stage. In 1989 China faced sanctions after the crackdown in Tiananmen Square. The next year America placed Cuba, El Salvador, Jordan, Kenya, Romania and Yemen under sanctions for various infractions. Several rounds of Western sanctions on Russia, first in 2014 and then again today, bring the message home still more forcefully.\nAlready there is evidence of a crude decoupling. In 2014 America banned Huawei, a Chinese tech firm, from bidding on American government contracts. In 2018 Mr Trump started a trade war with China, with the goal of forcing it to make changes to what America said were \u201cunfair trade practices\u201d, including the theft of intellectual property.  FDI  flows between China and America are now just $5bn a year, down from nearly $30bn five years ago.\nRecent policy announcements and trade deals shed some light on the probable direction of globalisation as the world\u2019s most powerful democracies and autocracies turn away from each other. Countries are signing smaller, regional trade deals instead; democracies are banding together, as are autocracies; and many countries are also seeking greater self-reliance.\nBegin with regional trade deals, the number of which is booming. In 2020 China signed an agreement with 14 other Asian countries, mostly non-democracies. In that year the  ASEAN  group of South-East Asian countries became China\u2019s biggest trading partner, replacing the  EU  . In Africa, meanwhile, most countries have ratified the African Continental Free Trade Area.\nCountries with shared political systems are also coming closer. The CoRe Partnership, an agreement between America and Japan, launched last year and is designed to promote co-operation in new technologies from mobile networks to biotech. The  US  -  EU  Trade and Technology Council, the pointed ambition of which is to promote \u201cthe spread of democratic, market-oriented values\u201d, is working on climate change and strengthening supply chains.\nAutocracies are also forming their own blocs. The stock of long-term investment from the autocratic world into China rose by over a fifth in 2020, even as the amount of investment from autocracies into America barely budged. Saudi Arabia is reportedly mulling selling oil to China in yuan, rather than dollars. Long-term investment from autocracies into increasingly illiberal India rose by 29% in 2020.\nLarge countries in particular, meanwhile, are also turning inward. A big focus of President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, for instance, is \u201csupply-chain resilience\u201d, which in part involves efforts to encourage domestic production. China\u2019s turn in 2020 towards a \u201cdual circulation\u201d strategy includes an attempt to rely less on global suppliers. It wants to release its rivals\u2019 grip on \u201cchokehold\u201d industries, such as chipmaking equipment, which it fears could be used to strangle its rise. India, too, has turned towards self-reliance.\nMany of these efforts could come at a price. Autocracies are notoriously prone to pursuing their own self-interests, rather than banding together. History shows that withdrawing from global trade and investment networks carries huge costs. In 1808 America came close to autarky as a result of a self-imposed embargo on international shipping. Research by Douglas Irwin of Dartmouth College suggests that the ban cost about 8% of America\u2019s gross national product. More recently, many studies have found that it was primarily American firms that paid for Mr Trump\u2019s tariffs. Brexit has slowed growth and investment in Britain.\nRussia\u2019s attempt at self-reliance, by pursuing import substitution on a large scale, building up foreign-exchange reserves and developing parallel technological networks, shows just how hard it is to cut yourself off from the global economy.  Sanctions  by the West rendered much of its reserves useless overnight. The economy was struggling even before the war, and has since gone off a cliff. Unemployment is likely to soar as foreign firms leave the country.\nThe risk, though, is that countries draw the opposite lesson from Russia: that less integration, rather than more, is the best way to protect themselves from economic pain. The world would become more fractured and mutually suspicious\u2014not to mention poorer than it could have been.  \u25a0\nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, business and markets,  sign up to Money Talks  , our weekly newsletter.\nRead more of our recent coverage of the  Ukraine crisis",

Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine provoked the biggest commodity shock since 1973, and one of the worst disruptions to wheat supplies in a century. Countries from Hungary to Indonesia are banning food exports to ensure supply at home. The West has issued sanctions against Russia, depriving it of all sorts of parts and technologies. </p><figure><figcaption> Listen to this story. </figcaption><span> Enjoy more audio and podcasts on <a href=\"https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25\"> iOS </a> or <a href=\"https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199\"> Android </a> . </span><audio controls=\"\"><p> Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element. </p></audio></figure><p> The strain on globalisation comes on top of the effects of the financial crisis of 2007-09, Brexit, President Donald Trump and the pandemic. For years measures of global integration have gone south. Between 2008 and 2019 world trade, relative to global <small> GDP </small> , fell by about five percentage points. Tariffs and other barriers to trade are piling up. Global flows of long-term investment fell by half between 2016 and 2019. Immigration is lower too, and not just because of border closures. </p><p> The war in Ukraine stands to accelerate another profound shift in global trade flows, by pitting large autocracies against liberal democracies. Such confrontation happened during the cold war, too. But this time autocracies are bigger, richer and more technologically sophisticated. Their share in global output, trade and innovation has risen, and they are key links in many supply chains. Attempts to drift apart, therefore, will bring new consequences, and costs, for the world economy. </p><p> After the second world war democracies ruled the economic roost. In 1960 America, Britain, Canada, France, Italy and Japan accounted for about 40% of global exports. Autocracies, by contrast, were economically unimportant on the world stage. The Soviet Union accounted for 4% of global trade; China barely featured in the statistics. Average <small> GDP </small> per head across the communist bloc was a tenth of America\u2019s. The West was locked in a fierce ideological battle with communist countries, filled with proxy wars and nuclear scares. But in economic terms there was no contest. </p><p> Their economies were also largely unintegrated. One observer in the late 1950s reckoned that trade between the <small> USSR </small> and America was so small that a big shipment could double the total from one month to another. The exceptions in east-west trade\u2014a bit of Russian gas to Europe; a wheat deal in 1972; a vodka-for-Pepsi swap from 1974\u2014were few. A study published by the <small> IMF </small> days before the Soviet Union fell said that \u201cforeign direct investment in the <small> USSR </small> has been minimal to date\u201d. </p><p> The communist bloc played by its own rules.

                    "relevance explanation": "The article discusses the impact of geopolitical events, such as the war in Ukraine, on global trade and supply chains. It highlights the strain on globalization due to geopolitical tensions, the effect of autocracies gaining economic power, and the trend of countries turning inward and seeking self-reliance. The article also talks about the potential consequences of reduced integration and the risks associated with countries drawing back from global trade and investment networks. Overall, the content of the article is relevant to the query about emerging technologies trade impacts due to the interconnected nature of global trade, the influence of geopolitical events on trade, and the potential shifts in trade dynamics.",
                    "relevant content": "T  HE WORLD'S  supply chains have taken a knock yet again. Russia's invasion of Ukraine provoked the biggest commodity shock since 1973, and one of the worst disruptions to wheat supplies in a century. Countries from Hungary to Indonesia are banning food exports to ensure supply at home. The West has issued sanctions against Russia, depriving it of all sorts of parts and technologies.\nThe strain on globalisation comes on top of the effects of the financial crisis of 2007-09, Brexit, President Donald Trump and the pandemic. For years measures of global integration have gone south. Between 2008 and 2019 world trade, relative to global  GDP  , fell by about five percentage points. Tariffs and other barriers to trade are piling up. Global flows of long-term investment fell by half between 2016 and 2019. Immigration is lower too, and not just because of border closures.\nThe war in Ukraine stands to accelerate another profound shift in global trade flows, by pitting large autocracies against liberal democracies. Such confrontation happened during the cold war, too. But this time autocracies are bigger, richer and more technologically sophisticated. Their share in global output, trade and innovation has risen, and they are key links in many supply chains. Attempts to drift apart, therefore, will bring new consequences, and costs, for the world economy.\nAfter the second world war democracies ruled the economic roost. In 1960 America, Britain, Canada, France, Italy and Japan accounted for about 40% of global exports. Autocracies, by contrast, were economically unimportant on the world stage. The Soviet Union accounted for 4% of global trade; China barely featured in the statistics. Average  GDP  per head across the communist bloc was a tenth of America's. The West was locked in a fierce ideological battle with communist countries, filled with proxy wars and nuclear scares. But in economic terms there was no contest.\nTheir economies were also largely unintegrated. One observer in the late 1950s reckoned that trade between the  USSR  and America was so small that a big shipment could double the total from one month to another. The exceptions in east-west tradea bit of Russian gas to Europe; a wheat deal in 1972; a vodka-for-Pepsi swap from 1974were few. A study published by the  IMF  days before the Soviet Union fell said that \"foreign direct investment in the  USSR  has been minimal to date\".\nThe communist bloc played by its own rules. Soviet external economic activity largely took place within  COMECON  , a group of sympathetic countries (China and the  USSR  barely traded with each other from the late 1950s, having fallen out). Trade in  COMECON  took place not via money-for-stuff, but in the form of a peculiar system of barteroil for manufactured goods, sayagreed by governments.\nFrom the late 1970s onwards, autocratic regimes began to open up. In part this was the result of an ideological change, first apparent in China. The death of Chairman Mao in 1976 allowed hitherto heretical views to emerge. \"Unless it could expand and modernise its economy more rapidly than it had done in previous decades, China would remain poor, weak and vulnerable,\" wrote Aaron Friedberg of Princeton University in a paper published in 2018, describing the ideas of Deng Xiaoping, the leader who spearheaded China's opening up in the 1980s. A focus on class struggle gave way to a desire for modernisation and development. Further momentum for globalisation came from the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.\nThe West, on the whole, welcomed and encouraged economic liberalisation, believing that it could be a force for good (and for large profits). By bringing countries into the global trading system it would be possible to raise living standards, as well as foster democracy and freedom. A globalised world would also be a more peaceful one, the argument went.\nIn the 1990s globalisation took off. Trade boomed. Annual global flows of foreign direct investment (  FDI  , including purchases of companies and the construction of new factories) rose by a factor of six. In 1990 Russia's first McDonald's opened, in Moscow;  KFC  set up shop a few years later. Russian oil companies began directing their exports towards the West. Between 1985 and 2015 Chinese goods exports to America rose by a factor of 125.\nLiving standards certainly went up. The number of people living in extreme poverty has fallen by 60% since 1990. Some formerly closed countries have utterly changed. The average Estonian is now only marginally poorer than the average Italian.\nThe other hoped-for benefit of globalisationpolitical liberalisationhas faltered, however. Our World in Data, a research organisation, puts countries into four groups, ranging from most to least free: \"liberal democracies\", such as America and Japan; more flawed \"electoral democracies\", such as Poland and Sri Lanka; \"electoral autocracies\", such as Turkey and Hungary; and \"closed autocracies\", such as China and Vietnam, where citizens have no real choice over their leader.\nClassifying political regimes is not an exact science, and involves making assumptions and judgments. Our World In Data counts India as an electoral autocracy since 2019, for instance, which some other sources do not agree with. Nonetheless, it helps give an idea of a broader trend: the waning might of liberal democracies.\nThe share of political regimes that were liberal democracies rose from 11% in 1970 to 23% in 2010. But democracy has retrenched since. Most of the 1.9bn people living in closed autocracies now reside in just one country: China. But lesser forms of autocracy are on the rise, such as in Turkey, where President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has consolidated power during his two decades in office (see chart 1).\nUsing data from the World Bank, the  IMF  and elsewhere, we divide the global economy into two. We estimate that today the autocratic world (ie, closed and electoral autocracies) accounts for over 30% of global  GDP  , more than double its share at the end of the cold war. Its share of global exports has soared over that period. The combined market value of its listed firms represented just 3% of the global total in 1989. Now it represents 30% (see chart 2).\nChina is by far the biggest non-democracy in economic terms, with a dollar  GDP  roughly two-thirds of America's, making up over half of our group of autocracies. But others, such as Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Vietnam, have also gained in economic clout over the past 30 years.\nAutocracies are now an especially serious rival to democracies when it comes to investment and innovation. In 2020 their governments and firms invested $9trn in everything from machinery and equipment to the construction of roads and railways. Democracies invested $12trn. Autocracies received more  FDI  than democracies between 2018 and 2020. And since the mid-1990s their share of patent applications has gone from 5% to over 60%. China dominates patenting, but on almost all our other measures the economic power of autocracies has soared even after China is excluded from our calculations.\nMany autocracies have remained steadfastly mercantilist. China, for instance, opened its domestic markets where it suited it, but kept whole sectors closed off to allow domestic champions to rise. Nonetheless autocracies have become integrated with democracies to an extent that would have been unthinkable during the cold war. Vietnam, which has been ruled by a single party for decades, for instance, has become a pivotal link in the global manufacturing supply chain. The kingdoms and emirates of the Middle East are vital sources of oil and gas.\nWe estimate that roughly one-third of democracies' goods imports come from other political regimes. The codependency in some markets is clear. Democracies produce about two-thirds of the oil necessary to meet their daily needs. The rest must come from somewhere else. Half of the coffee that fills Europeans' cups comes from places where people have weak political rights. And that is before getting to precious metals and rare earths.\nIntegration goes far beyond trade. American multinationals employ 3m people outside democracies, a rise of 90% in the past decade (their total foreign employment has increased by a third). Investors from democracies hold over a third of the autocratic world's total stock of inward  FDI  . Autocracies have built up huge foreign reserves, now worth more than $7trn and often denominated in \"free\" currencies like the dollar and the euro.\n\nBROKEN DREAM\nThis intimacy is now under threat as a third, darker period comes into view. Even before the war in Ukraine, powerful countries were losing interest in a truly global presence. Instead they were seeking to rely more on themselves or to dominate their immediate geographical area. Their new thinking is becoming increasingly enshrined in strategy and policy.\nThe waning appetite for globalisation has a few causes. One relates to greater consumer awareness in the West about human-rights abuses in places such as China and Vietnam. Polls in Western countries regularly find that a high share of respondents support boycotting Chinese goods (whether they would actually do so is another matter). Western companies are being pressed to source goods elsewhere. Concerns over the national-security implications of trade and investment, including industrial espionage, have also risen.\nAutocracies have their own worries. One is that too much integration can cause Western culture to seep across borders, weakening autocratic rule. Deng himself identified the dilemma: \"If you open the window for fresh air, you have to expect some flies to blow in.\"\nAnother, bigger worry relates to power. Being part of global supply chains means being vulnerable to sanctions. This was clear from an early stage. In 1989 China faced sanctions after the crackdown in Tiananmen Square. The next year America placed Cuba, El Salvador, Jordan, Kenya, Romania and Yemen under sanctions for various infractions. Several rounds of Western sanctions on Russia, first in 2014 and then again today, bring the message home still more forcefully.\nAlready there is evidence of a crude decoupling. In 2014 America banned Huawei, a Chinese tech firm, from bidding on American government contracts. In 2018 Mr Trump started a trade war with China, with the goal of forcing it to make changes to what America said were \"unfair trade practices\", including the theft of intellectual property.  FDI  flows between China and America are now just $5bn a year, down from nearly $30bn five years ago.\nRecent policy announcements and trade deals shed some light on the probable direction of globalisation as the world's most powerful democracies and autocracies turn away from each other. Countries are signing smaller, regional trade deals instead; democracies are banding together, as are autocracies; and many countries are also seeking greater self-reliance.\nBegin with regional trade deals, the number of which is booming. In 2020 China signed an agreement with 14 other Asian countries, mostly non-democracies. In that year the  ASEAN  group of South-East Asian countries became China's biggest trading partner, replacing the  EU  . In Africa, meanwhile, most countries have ratified the African Continental Free Trade Area.\nCountries with shared political systems are also coming closer. The CoRe Partnership, an agreement between America and Japan, launched last year and is designed to promote co-operation in new technologies from mobile networks to biotech. The  US  -  EU  Trade and Technology Council, the pointed ambition of which is to promote \"the spread of democratic, market-oriented values\", is working on climate change and strengthening supply chains.\nAutocracies are also forming their own blocs. The stock of long-term investment from the autocratic world into China rose by over a fifth in 2020, even as the amount of investment from autocracies into America barely budged. Saudi Arabia is reportedly mulling selling oil to China in yuan, rather than dollars. Long-term investment from autocracies into increasingly illiberal India rose by 29% in 2020.\nLarge countries in particular, meanwhile, are also turning inward. A big focus of President Joe Biden's administration, for instance, is \"supply-chain resilience\", which in part involves efforts to encourage domestic production. China's turn in 2020 towards a \"dual circulation\" strategy includes an attempt to rely less on global suppliers. It wants to release its rivals' grip on \"chokehold\" industries, such as chipmaking equipment, which it fears could be used to strangle its rise. India, too, has turned towards self-reliance.\nMany of these efforts could come at a price. Autocracies are notoriously prone to pursuing their own self-interests, rather than banding together. History shows that withdrawing from global trade and investment networks carries huge costs. In 1808 America came close to autarky as a result of a self-imposed embargo on international shipping. Research by Douglas Irwin of Dartmouth College suggests that the ban cost about 8% of America's gross national product. More recently, many studies have found that it was primarily American firms that paid for Mr Trump's tariffs. Brexit has slowed growth and investment in Britain.\nRussia's attempt at self-reliance, by pursuing import substitution on a large scale, building up foreign-exchange reserves and developing parallel technological networks, shows just how hard it is to cut yourself off from the global economy.  Sanctions  by the West rendered much of its reserves useless overnight. The economy was struggling even before the war, and has since gone off a cliff. Unemployment is likely to soar as foreign firms leave the country.\nThe risk, though, is that countries draw the opposite lesson from Russia: that less integration, rather than more, is the best way to protect themselves from economic pain. The world would become more fractured and mutually suspiciousnot to mention poorer than it could have been.  \nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, business and markets,  sign up to Money Talks  , our weekly newsletter.\nRead more of our recent coverage of the  Ukraine crisis"

                            "text": "All that activity produces vast amounts of data that help reinforce the platforms. Beijing has asserted control over it all and made clear that any new initiatives must align with its priorities. That means fewer live-streaming apps and more research into cutting-edge technologies, from artificial intelligence to cloud computing and advanced semiconductors.\nMore broadly, Xi\u2019s administration blames widening social disparities in part on the internet boom, particularly in the pandemic era, and is moving to address any public discontent that could threaten its authority. That led to the \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d program, which has faded from public view but still guides the activities of many of the sector\u2019s leaders, who pledged to treat their workers better and donate billions of dollars to charity.\nAs a corollary, any attempts to hoard wealth and sabotage rivals \u2014 such as through undercutting prices or coercing merchants into exclusive deals, a key aspect of the 2021 antitrust investigations \u2014 remain off-limits.\n\nWILL THEY EVER REGAIN PRE-CRACKDOWN HEIGHTS?\nThat seems unlikely. Before 2020, Beijing\u2019s hands-off approach to the technology sector minted billionaires and giant companies at a breath-taking pace, at one point inviting comparisons to Silicon Valley.\nAlibaba, Tencent and Ant had a combined market capitalisation of nearly US$2 trillion that year \u2014 easily surpassing state-owned behemoths like Industrial & Commercial Bank of China as the country\u2019s most valuable companies.\nA rally that pushed Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Tech Index, a barometer for the mainland\u2019s biggest companies, to its highest levels since inception started to unravel in February 2021, wiping out more than US$1 trillion in value at one point that year.\nAnt and its part-owner Alibaba is a case in point. The two companies alone are estimated to have shed more than US$800 billion of value between them since 2020.\n\nWHO'S MAKING MOVES?\nDuring the crackdown, companies including ByteDance's TikTok,  Shein Group  and Tencent began expanding abroad in pursuit of less-encumbered growth opportunities, adapting their tried-and-true strategies to global markets.\nSome have run into roadblocks, however, in places like the US and India that have stepped up scrutiny of Chinese-owned services on national security grounds. Alibaba\u2019s historic split is set to energise competition in areas such as the cloud, online commerce and logistics.

That led to the \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d program, which has faded from public view but still guides the activities of many of the sector\u2019s leaders, who pledged to treat their workers better and donate billions of dollars to charity. </p><p> As a corollary, any attempts to hoard wealth and sabotage rivals \u2014 such as through undercutting prices or coercing merchants into exclusive deals, a key aspect of the 2021 antitrust investigations \u2014 remain off-limits. </p><h2> WILL THEY EVER REGAIN PRE-CRACKDOWN HEIGHTS? </h2><p> That seems unlikely. Before 2020, Beijing\u2019s hands-off approach to the technology sector minted billionaires and giant companies at a breath-taking pace, at one point inviting comparisons to Silicon Valley. </p><p> Alibaba, Tencent and Ant had a combined market capitalisation of nearly US$2 trillion that year \u2014 easily surpassing state-owned behemoths like Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China as the country\u2019s most valuable companies. </p><p> A rally that pushed Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Tech Index, a barometer for the mainland\u2019s biggest companies, to its highest levels since inception started to unravel in February 2021, wiping out more than US$1 trillion in value at one point that year. </p><p> Ant and its part-owner Alibaba is a case in point. The two companies alone are estimated to have shed more than US$800 billion of value between them since 2020. </p><h2> WHO'S MAKING MOVES? </h2><p> During the crackdown, companies including ByteDance's TikTok, <a href=\"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/shein-china-factory-tour-social-media-us-fashion-influencers-criticism-what-went-wrong-3599751\"> Shein Group </a> and Tencent began expanding abroad in pursuit of less-encumbered growth opportunities, adapting their tried-and-true strategies to global markets. </p><p> Some have run into roadblocks, however, in places like the US and India that have stepped up scrutiny of Chinese-owned services on national security grounds.

These sectors where foreign investments are off-limits include nuclear power plants, publishing and telecom.\nEarlier at the dialogue session, Mr Gan delivered a speech where he touched on the global challenges confronting Singapore.\n\u201cWe exited the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic earlier this year, but we have stepped into a rather unstable and unpredictable environment. New challenges have emerged and in some instances, are intensifying,\u201d he said.\nThese include slower global growth amid monetary policy tightening worldwide to combat inflation, the multilateral open trading system coming under pressure, the rise of new technology such as generative artificial intelligence (AI) that has disrupted industries and businesses, as well as climate change.\nHowever, these \u201cdaunting\u201d challenges can also present opportunities for Singapore, the minister said.\nSingapore, for one, can continue to distinguish itself as \u201ca trusted and reliable trading partner\u201d. The emergence of new technologies and the net zero transition also serve up opportunities to grow the country\u2019s digital and green economy, respectively.\nEfforts to capitalise on these opportunities are underway, said Mr Gan, pointing to the  Singapore Economy 2023 vision  announced last year.

                            "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: For quite a while now, pilot Mohd Radzi Desa, 58, has been planning on getting an electric vehicle (EV) as his next car.\n\nPOSITIVE POLICIES ATTRACT INVESTORS\nIn August, EP Manufacturing Berhad \u2013 a local auto parts manufacturer \u2013 signed a memorandum of understanding with BAIC Motor Corporation Ltd - one of China\u2019s largest automobile groups - to develop local production of vehicles including EVs in Malaysia.\nChinese automaker Geely - which holds a 49.9 per cent stake in Malaysian manufacturer Proton - meanwhile will invest RM30 billion in the development and commercialisation of the Automotive High-Tech Valley (AHTV) in Tanjung Malim, Perak with a focus on EV.\nBut Mr Shahrol Halmi, the co-founder of the Malaysia Electric Vehicles Owners Club (MyEVOC) told CNA that Tesla\u2019s moves made the biggest news on EVs because many were surprised by how \u201caffordable\u201d it was in relation to other brands.\n\u201cIt is very big news. BYD was a hot seller when it was launched earlier this year at RM170,000 but you don\u2019t need to top up much more to get a Tesla model Y while a comparable BMW i4 is substantially higher in price,\u201d he said.\nThere are more than 40 models of EVs currently being sold in the Malaysian market.\nBesides Tesla, they include models from newer brands in the Malaysian market such as BYD, Ora and Neta from China as well as BMW, Volvo, Mercedes, Hyundai and even Rolls Royce.\nMr Shahrol believes Malaysia\u2019s EV push began when the government approved the Low Carbon Mobility Blueprint (LCMB) in Oct 2021, a policy framework that sought to reduce emissions from the transportation sector, ranked as the second-largest emitter of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) after the energy sector.\nDuring the 2022 Budget, the government announced full exemption from import and excise duties as well as sales tax for EVs, road tax exemption for EVs, and income tax reliefs for the purchase of charging facilities.\nThe government this year then extended import duty exemptions for components for the local assembly of EVs, the excise duty and sales tax exemptions for locally assembled completely knocked down (CKD) EVs to 2027, as well as the import and excise duty exemptions on imported completely built-up (CBU) units to 2025.\nCBU refers to cars that are imported while CKDs are cars manufactured in the country.\nEV users also don\u2019t have to pay road tax until 2025.\nMr Jigar Shah, head of sustainability sesearch of Maybank Investment Banking Group, told CNA that the entry of Tesla and the investment proposed by Geely in the EV sector in Malaysia are positive reflections of the recent policies set by the government.\n\u201cMalaysia is setting prudent and proactive policies to benefit from the coming boom in the EV sector especially by attracting investment from Tesla and announcing a massive increase in share of renewables in the next two to three decades,\u201d he said.\nMr Jigar pointed out that local Malaysian companies such as Petronas and Yinson are also setting up charging stations, which will be critical as consumers shift to EV from traditional Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles that run on fossil fuels such as petrol or diesel.\nHe also said that a recent government decision to significantly increase the share of renewables to 70 per cent in the total energy mix by 2050 was very positive for the EV sector as well.\nHe added that Malaysia is the third largest car market within ASEAN behind Indonesia and Thailand, and its per capita transport emissions are higher than the world average,\n\u201cThese developments augur well for the country to scale up fast and transition the entire ICE vehicle sector to electric in the next 10 to 15 years,\u201d Mr Jigar said, adding that Malaysia has an opportunity to develop an EV manufacturing base and ecosystem for the local and export markets.\nMalaysia has targeted 15 per cent of total industry volume (TIV) to be contributed by EV and hybrid vehicles by 2030 and 38 per cent of TIV by 2040.\nRakuten Trade head of equity sales Vincent Lau told CNA that recent developments in the Malaysian EV sector are significantly shaping its growth prospects, saying that brands such as BYD and Ota are offering EVs that are more \u201caffordable\u201d.\n\u201cIt is still too early to say that Malaysia can be an EV powerhouse, but they are on the right track with the policies that are in place,\u201d he said.\nIn 2022, EV sales in Malaysia totalled 2,631 while the year before it was 271 sales.\nBMI, a Fitch Solutions company forecasted in a commentary on Aug 24 that Malaysia\u2019s total EV sales will quadruple this year, although the EV penetration rate in the country would be at just 1.8 per cent.\n\nLONG ROAD AHEAD FOR EV PRODUCTION IN MALAYSIA\nMr Shahrol of MyEvoc said that in terms of manufacturing EVs, Malaysia still lags the likes of Thailand who are the leading market of EVs in the region.\nAccording to a report by the Nation, Thailand manufactured 92,746 EVs in 2022, an increase of about 38 per cent compared to the previous year. Altogether Thailand was reported to have assembled 1.9 million vehicles last year.\nOther countries in Southeast Asia that are making a push to attract investors in the EV industry include Indonesia and Vietnam.\nThe Indonesian government has targeted EVs to make up one-fifth of all domestically manufactured vehicles by 2025 while Vietnam\u2019s own manufacturer VinFast is now focusing only on EVs.\n\u201cFrom the government perspective, manufacturing provides jobs, especially as EVs are geared towards integration of software and high technology. We can understand why it is a new frontier the government is keen to get a head start in,\u201d said Mr Shahrol.\nAccording to the International Energy Association (IEA), global sales of electric cars are set to grow by 35 per cent this year, expanding its share of the overall car market to 18 per cent.\nIndustry players say this is why countries including Malaysia are aggressively pushing for investments for EV investments.\nCurrently, only Volvo and Mercedes are assembling EVs in Malaysia.\nMr Charles Frump, managing director of Volvo Car Malaysia, told CNA that the increased interest and investments by automotive firms in Malaysia's EV sector signals a promising future for the country's automotive industry.\nHe said that the company is aiming for 50 per cent of their global sales to be fully electric cars by 2025, and for all new cars to be fully electric by 2030.\nVolvo was the first to assemble an EV in Malaysia - its XC40 SUV model - at its plant in Shah Alam, Selangor since last year.\nHe added that Malaysia is now Volvo Cars\u2019 regional hub, exporting EVs to neighbouring countries such as Indonesia, Taiwan, Thailand, Philippines, and Vietnam.\n\u201cThe increased interest and investments by automotive firms in Malaysia's EV sector signals a promising future for the country's automotive industry,\u201d Mr Frump said, in an emailed response to queries by CNA on the EV industry in Malaysia.\n\u201cWith Government support for EV infrastructure and with the surge of traditional and new brands entering the local EV space, we are seeing an affirmation of our electrification ambitions and a growing interest for local EV adoption in the coming years.\u201d\nAccording to the BMI report, Mercedes has indicated that it plans to have 30 percent of all its vehicles sold in Malaysia electrified by 2030, as the country offers one of the highest EV penetration rates for its products globally.\nMalaysia\u2019s International Trade and Industry Minister Tengku Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz had said in July that as the EV industry is relatively new to Malaysia, many investors, both local and foreign, are still waiting for \u201ccertainties\u201d in the market before making any investment decision.",

                    "relevant content": "KUALA LUMPUR: For quite a while now, pilot Mohd Radzi Desa, 58, has been planning on getting an electric vehicle (EV) as his next car.\n\nPOSITIVE POLICIES ATTRACT INVESTORS\nIn August, EP Manufacturing Berhad  a local auto parts manufacturer  signed a memorandum of understanding with BAIC Motor Corporation Ltd - one of China's largest automobile groups - to develop local production of vehicles including EVs in Malaysia.\nChinese automaker Geely - which holds a 49.9 per cent stake in Malaysian manufacturer Proton - meanwhile will invest RM30 billion in the development and commercialisation of the Automotive High-Tech Valley (AHTV) in Tanjung Malim, Perak with a focus on EV.\nBut Mr Shahrol Halmi, the co-founder of the Malaysia Electric Vehicles Owners Club (MyEVOC) told CNA that Tesla's moves made the biggest news on EVs because many were surprised by how \"affordable\" it was in relation to other brands.\n\"It is very big news. BYD was a hot seller when it was launched earlier this year at RM170,000 but you don't need to top up much more to get a Tesla model Y while a comparable BMW i4 is substantially higher in price,\" he said.\nThere are more than 40 models of EVs currently being sold in the Malaysian market.\nBesides Tesla, they include models from newer brands in the Malaysian market such as BYD, Ora and Neta from China as well as BMW, Volvo, Mercedes, Hyundai and even Rolls Royce.\nMr Shahrol believes Malaysia's EV push began when the government approved the Low Carbon Mobility Blueprint (LCMB) in Oct 2021, a policy framework that sought to reduce emissions from the transportation sector, ranked as the second-largest emitter of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) after the energy sector.\nDuring the 2022 Budget, the government announced full exemption from import and excise duties as well as sales tax for EVs, road tax exemption for EVs, and income tax reliefs for the purchase of charging facilities.\nThe government this year then extended import duty exemptions for components for the local assembly of EVs, the excise duty and sales tax exemptions for locally assembled completely knocked down (CKD) EVs to 2027, as well as the import and excise duty exemptions on imported completely built-up (CBU) units to 2025.\nCBU refers to cars that are imported while CKDs are cars manufactured in the country.\nEV users also don't have to pay road tax until 2025.\nMr Jigar Shah, head of sustainability sesearch of Maybank Investment Banking Group, told CNA that the entry of Tesla and the investment proposed by Geely in the EV sector in Malaysia are positive reflections of the recent policies set by the government.\n\"Malaysia is setting prudent and proactive policies to benefit from the coming boom in the EV sector especially by attracting investment from Tesla and announcing a massive increase in share of renewables in the next two to three decades,\" he said.\nMr Jigar pointed out that local Malaysian companies such as Petronas and Yinson are also setting up charging stations, which will be critical as consumers shift to EV from traditional Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles that run on fossil fuels such as petrol or diesel.\nHe also said that a recent government decision to significantly increase the share of renewables to 70 per cent in the total energy mix by 2050 was very positive for the EV sector as well.\nHe added that Malaysia is the third largest car market within ASEAN behind Indonesia and Thailand, and its per capita transport emissions are higher than the world average,\n\"These developments augur well for the country to scale up fast and transition the entire ICE vehicle sector to electric in the next 10 to 15 years,\" Mr Jigar said, adding that Malaysia has an opportunity to develop an EV manufacturing base and ecosystem for the local and export markets.\nMalaysia has targeted 15 per cent of total industry volume (TIV) to be contributed by EV and hybrid vehicles by 2030 and 38 per cent of TIV by 2040.\nRakuten Trade head of equity sales Vincent Lau told CNA that recent developments in the Malaysian EV sector are significantly shaping its growth prospects, saying that brands such as BYD and Ota are offering EVs that are more \"affordable\".\n\"It is still too early to say that Malaysia can be an EV powerhouse, but they are on the right track with the policies that are in place,\" he said.\nIn 2022, EV sales in Malaysia totalled 2,631 while the year before it was 271 sales.\nBMI, a Fitch Solutions company forecasted in a commentary on Aug 24 that Malaysia's total EV sales will quadruple this year, although the EV penetration rate in the country would be at just 1.8 per cent.\n\nLONG ROAD AHEAD FOR EV PRODUCTION IN MALAYSIA\nMr Shahrol of MyEvoc said that in terms of manufacturing EVs, Malaysia still lags the likes of Thailand who are the leading market of EVs in the region.\nAccording to a report by the Nation, Thailand manufactured 92,746 EVs in 2022, an increase of about 38 per cent compared to the previous year.

Stocks such as NAURA Technology Group, up 14 per cent, Piotech Inc up 45 per cent, and ACM Research Shanghai Inc up 19 per cent, have led the way.\nJapan this week finalised export control rules, effective on July 23, joining the U.S. in a push to curb China's ability to make advanced chips.\nU.S. politicians' calls this week to sanction CXMT following Beijing's ban on U.S. chipmaker Micron Technology also boosted shares in Chinese memory chipmakers such as ZBIT Semiconductor Inc, up 26 per cent this week, and Montage Technology Co, up 4 per cent.\nThe nationalistic fervour boosting these select sectors and shares has also been lucrative for investors in an environment of sluggish and uneven domestic growth after China's economic reopening in January. China's benchmark stock indexes rallied in anticipation of a bumper post-pandemic recovery but have erased all gains since.\nBrokerage Citic Securities said that U.S. and Japanese curbs against China's chipmaking industry will only accelerate Chinese efforts to replace foreign technology and invite stronger government support.\nLUMBERING STATE FIRMS REVALUED\nReflecting the flag-waving fervour, at least eight asset managers have applied to China's securities regulator to launch the first batch of investment products tracking the CSI Computing Infrastructure Index, seen as the most vulnerable to foreign sanctions, and a vital area in the tech war.\nNew fund launches will potentially channel money into China's technology and chipmaking leaders, including ZTE Corp, Unisplendour Co, Montage and Cambricon Technologies.\nIt comes as investors are also being subtly nudged - via favourable brokerage reports and mutual fund launches - to invest in state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which Beijing hopes can play a key role in the Sino-U.S. tech war.\n\"If we want to realize technology replacement in the future, SOEs are the best platform,\" said Yang Zhenjian, fund manager at Bosera Asset Management.\nCutting-edge innovation requires huge and long-term investment, which is beyond the ability of private companies, \"but SOEs can do it,\" Yang said.\nTo facilitate SOE fundraising, Chinese regulators have since late last year called for a revaluation of the state sector, boosting shares in U.S.-blacklisted companies such as China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom.\nAn index tracking innovative central SOEs has jumped 14 per cent this year.\nYuan Yuwei, hedge fund manager at Water Wisdom Asset Management, said he is bullish on Chinese chip equipment companies, state-owned telecom giants, and indigenous software makers that challenge U.S. rivals in China.\nFor example, Kingsoft Office, a Microsoft rival that is being adopted widely by Chinese governments and SOEs, has surged nearly 50 per cent this year.\nLiu of Zhangying Investment admitted there's some froth in certain sectors supported by Beijing. For example, China's chipmaking sector is now trading at 60 times earnings, compared with 16 for the broad market.\nBut \"China needs high valuation in some sectors ... Why don't you put down your wager, while also supporting the country's development?\"",

China's benchmark stock indexes rallied in anticipation of a bumper post-pandemic recovery but have erased all gains since. </p><p> Brokerage Citic Securities said that U.S. and Japanese curbs against China's chipmaking industry will only accelerate Chinese efforts to replace foreign technology and invite stronger government support. </p><p> LUMBERING STATE FIRMS REVALUED </p><p> Reflecting the flag-waving fervour, at least eight asset managers have applied to China's securities regulator to launch the first batch of investment products tracking the CSI Computing Infrastructure Index, seen as the most vulnerable to foreign sanctions, and a vital area in the tech war. </p><p> New fund launches will potentially channel money into China's technology and chipmaking leaders, including ZTE Corp, Unisplendour Co, Montage and Cambricon Technologies. </p><p> It comes as investors are also being subtly nudged - via favourable brokerage reports and mutual fund launches - to invest in state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which Beijing hopes can play a key role in the Sino-U.S. tech war. </p><p> \"If we want to realize technology replacement in the future, SOEs are the best platform,\" said Yang Zhenjian, fund manager at Bosera Asset Management. </p><p> Cutting-edge innovation requires huge and long-term investment, which is beyond the ability of private companies, \"but SOEs can do it,\" Yang said. </p><p> To facilitate SOE fundraising, Chinese regulators have since late last year called for a revaluation of the state sector, boosting shares in U.S.-blacklisted companies such as China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom. </p><p> An index tracking innovative central SOEs has jumped 14 per cent this year. </p><p> Yuan Yuwei, hedge fund manager at Water Wisdom Asset Management, said he is bullish on Chinese chip equipment companies, state-owned telecom giants, and indigenous software makers that challenge U.S. rivals in China. </p><p> For example, Kingsoft Office, a Microsoft rival that is being adopted widely by Chinese governments and SOEs, has surged nearly 50 per cent this year. </p><p> Liu of Zhangying Investment admitted there's some froth in certain sectors supported by Beijing. For example, China's chipmaking sector is now trading at 60 times earnings, compared with 16 for the broad market. </p><p> But \"China needs high valuation in some sectors ... Why don't you put down your wager, while also supporting the country's development?\" </p>",

China has already attracted thousands from around the world to fill research-related positions  .\n\nBILLIONS POURING INTO SUBSIDISING INNOVATION\nTo be sure, over the last two years, China\u2019s central government has taken sweeping action to regulate and rein in tech giants in the name of antitrust, social equity and data protection.

This means the equivalent of billions \u2013 maybe trillions \u2013 of dollars will go toward subsidising innovation, from supporting basic research to building science parks.\nThe effort will inevitably waste resources.

The state will pay to cast a wide net in return for a big catch.\n\nCHINA MUST DO MORE FOR REAL TECH BREAKTHROUGHS\nThis strategy may help China accelerate its mastery of high-tech products, but to make real technological breakthroughs, the country needs a much more open education system.\nIt also must create an innovation process in which people are motivated both by market rewards and an intrinsic desire to advance knowledge.\nChina\u2019s old \u201cshort, flat, fast\u201d investment strategy, which has worked for sports and infrastructure, must give way to a new playbook for technology, adopted by a patient country with patient people and patient capital.\nOne thing is clear: Given the Chinese response to US pressure on its tech giants, it is safe to assume that further restrictions will only strengthen China\u2019s determination to achieve technological self-sufficiency \u2013 and, eventually, global primacy.

The state will pay to cast a wide net in return for a big catch.\n\nCHINA MUST DO MORE FOR REAL TECH BREAKTHROUGHS\nThis strategy may help China accelerate its mastery of high-tech products, but to make real technological breakthroughs, the country needs a much more open education system.\nIt also must create an innovation process in which people are motivated both by market rewards and an intrinsic desire to advance knowledge.\nChina's old \"short, flat, fast\" investment strategy, which has worked for sports and infrastructure, must give way to a new playbook for technology, adopted by a patient country with patient people and patient capital.\nOne thing is clear: Given the Chinese response to US pressure on its tech giants, it is safe to assume that further restrictions will only strengthen China's determination to achieve technological self-sufficiency  and, eventually, global primacy. This should provide the Biden administration with some food for thought as it considers its next steps.\nKeyu Jin is a Professor of Economics at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

It incorporates professional movements into the game\u2019s player movement database, thus enhancing the realism of the game, and significantly reducing the cost of hiring professional players for the motion capture.\nAdvertisement\n\nEver a technology company, Gala Technology increased its input in technology and product research and development in 2022 and in the first half of 2023.

                            "text": "A  re we truly so precious?\u201d Dean Baquet, the executive editor of the  New York Times  , asked me one Wednesday evening in June 2020. I was the editorial-page editor of the  Times  , and we had just published an op-ed by  Tom Cotton  , a senator from Arkansas, that was outraging many members of the  Times  staff. America\u2019s conscience had been shocked days before by images of a white police officer kneeling on the neck of a black man, George Floyd, until he died. It was a frenzied time in America, assaulted by covid-19, scalded by police barbarism. Throughout the country  protesters were on the march  . Substantive reform of the police, so long delayed, suddenly seemed like a real possibility, but so did violence and political backlash. In some cities rioting and looting had broken out.\nIt was the kind of crisis in which journalism could fulfil its highest ambitions of helping readers understand the world, in order to fix it, and in the  Times  \u2019s Opinion section, which I oversaw, we were pursuing our role of presenting  debate from all sides  . We had published pieces arguing against the idea of relying on troops to stop the violence, and one urging abolition of the police altogether. But Cotton, an army veteran, was calling for the use of troops to protect lives and businesses from rioters. Some  Times  reporters and other staff were taking to what was then called Twitter, now called X, to attack the decision to publish his argument, for fear he would persuade  Times  readers to support his proposal and it would be enacted. The next day the  Times  \u2019s union\u2014its unit of the NewsGuild-  CWA  \u2014would issue a statement calling the op-ed \u201ca clear threat to the health and safety of the journalists we represent\u201d.\nThe  Times  had endured many cycles of Twitter outrage for one story or opinion piece or another. It was never fun; it felt like sticking your head in a metal bucket while people were banging it with hammers. The publisher, A.G. Sulzberger, who was about two years into the job, understood why we\u2019d published the op-ed. He had some criticisms about packaging; he said the editors should add links to other op-eds we\u2019d published with a different view. But he\u2019d emailed me that afternoon, saying: \u201cI get and support the reason for including the piece,\u201d because, he thought, Cotton\u2019s view had the support of the White House as well as a majority of the Senate. As the clamour grew, he asked me to call Baquet, the paper\u2019s most senior editor.\nLike me, Baquet seemed taken aback by the criticism that  Times  readers shouldn\u2019t hear what Cotton had to say. Cotton had a lot of influence with the White House, Baquet noted, and he could well be making his argument directly to the president, Donald Trump. Readers should know about it. Cotton was also a possible future contender for the White House himself, Baquet added. And, besides, Cotton was far from alone: lots of Americans agreed with him\u2014most of them, according to some polls. \u201cAre we truly so precious?\u201d Baquet asked again, with a note of wonder and frustration.\nThe answer, it turned out, was yes. Less than three days later, on Saturday morning, Sulzberger called me at home and, with an icy anger that still puzzles and saddens me, demanded my resignation. I got mad, too, and said he\u2019d have to fire me. I thought better of that later. I called him back and agreed to resign, flattering myself that I was being noble.\nWhether or not American democracy endures, a central question historians are sure to ask about this era is why America came to elect Donald Trump, promoting him from a symptom of the country\u2019s institutional, political and social degradation to its agent-in-chief. There are many reasons for Trump\u2019s ascent, but changes in the American news media played a critical role. Trump\u2019s manipulation and every one of his political lies became more powerful because journalists had forfeited what had always been most valuable about their work: their credibility as arbiters of truth and brokers of ideas, which for more than a century, despite all of journalism\u2019s flaws and failures, had been a bulwark of how Americans govern themselves.\nI hope those historians will also be able to tell the story of how journalism found its footing again \u2013 how editors, reporters and readers, too, came to recognise that journalism needed to change to fulfil its potential in restoring the health of American politics. As Trump\u2019s nomination and possible re-election loom, that work could not be more urgent.\nI think Sulzberger shares this analysis. In interviews and his own writings, including an essay earlier this year for the  Columbia Journalism Review  , he has defended \u201cindependent journalism\u201d, or, as I understand him, fair-minded, truth-seeking journalism that aspires to be open and objective. It\u2019s good to hear the publisher speak up in defence of such values, some of which have fallen out of fashion not just with journalists at the  Times  and other mainstream publications but at some of the most prestigious schools of journalism. Until that miserable Saturday morning I thought I was standing shoulder-to-shoulder with him in a struggle to revive them. I thought, and still think, that no American institution could have a better chance than the  Times  , by virtue of its principles, its history, its people and its hold on the attention of influential Americans, to lead the resistance to the corruption of political and intellectual life, to overcome the encroaching dogmatism and intolerance.\nBut Sulzberger seems to underestimate the struggle he is in, that all journalism and indeed America itself is in. In describing the essential qualities of independent journalism in his essay, he unspooled a list of admirable traits \u2013 empathy, humility, curiosity and so forth. These qualities have for generations been helpful in contending with the  Times  \u2019s familiar problem, which is liberal bias. I have no doubt Sulzberger believes in them. Years ago he demonstrated them himself as a reporter, covering the American Midwest as a real place full of three-dimensional people, and it would be nice if they were enough to deal with the challenge of this era, too. But, on their own, these qualities have no chance against the  Times  \u2019s new, more dangerous problem, which is in crucial respects the opposite of the old one.\nThe  Times  \u2019s problem has metastasised from liberal bias to illiberal bias, from an inclination to favour one side of the national debate to an impulse to shut debate down altogether. All the empathy and humility in the world will not mean much against the pressures of intolerance and tribalism without an invaluable quality that Sulzberger did not emphasise: courage.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. Most journalism obviously doesn\u2019t require anything like the bravery expected of a soldier, police officer or protester. But far more than when I set out to become a journalist, doing the work right today demands a particular kind of courage: not just the devil-may-care courage to choose a profession on the brink of the abyss; not just the bulldog courage to endlessly pick yourself up and embrace the ever-evolving technology; but also, in an era when polarisation and social media viciously enforce rigid orthodoxies, the moral and intellectual courage to take the other side seriously and to report truths and ideas that your own side demonises for fear they will harm its cause.\nOne of the glories of embracing illiberalism is that, like Trump, you are always right about everything, and so you are justified in shouting disagreement down. In the face of this, leaders of many workplaces and boardrooms across America find that it is so much easier to compromise than to confront \u2013 to give a little ground today in the belief you can ultimately bring people around. This is how reasonable Republican leaders lost control of their party to Trump and how liberal-minded college presidents lost control of their campuses. And it is why the leadership of the  New York Times  is losing control of its principles.\nOver the decades the  Times  and other mainstream news organisations failed plenty of times to live up to their commitments to integrity and open-mindedness. The relentless struggle against biases and preconceptions, rather than the achievement of a superhuman objective omniscience, is what mattered. As everyone knows, the internet knocked the industry off its foundations. Local newspapers were the proving ground between college campuses and national newsrooms. As they disintegrated, the national news media lost a source of seasoned reporters and many Americans lost a journalism whose truth they could verify with their own eyes. As the country became more polarised, the national media followed the money by serving partisan audiences the versions of reality they preferred. This relationship proved self-reinforcing. As Americans became freer to choose among alternative versions of reality, their polarisation intensified. When I was at the  Times  , the newsroom editors worked hardest to keep Washington coverage open and unbiased, no easy task in the Trump era. And there are still people, in the Washington bureau and across the  Times  , doing work as fine as can be found in American journalism. But as the top editors let bias creep into certain areas of coverage, such as culture, lifestyle and business, that made the core harder to defend and undermined the authority of even the best reporters.\nThere have been signs the  Times  is trying to recover the courage of its convictions. The paper was slow to display much curiosity about the hard question of the proper medical protocols for trans children; but once it did, the editors defended their coverage against the inevitable criticism. For any counter-revolution to succeed, the leadership will need to show courage worthy of the paper\u2019s bravest reporters and opinion columnists, the ones who work in war zones or explore ideas that make illiberal staff members shudder. As Sulzberger told me in the past, returning to the old standards will require agonising change. He saw that as the gradual work of many years, but I think he is mistaken. To overcome the cultural and commercial pressures the  Times  faces, particularly given the severe test posed by another Trump candidacy and possible presidency, its publisher and senior editors will have to be bolder than that.\nSince Adolph Ochs bought the paper in 1896, one of the most inspiring things the  Times  has said about itself is that it does its work \u201cwithout fear or favour\u201d. That is not true of the institution today \u2013 it cannot be, not when its journalists are afraid to trust readers with a mainstream conservative argument such as Cotton\u2019s, and its leaders are afraid to say otherwise. As preoccupied as it is with the question of why so many Americans have lost trust in it, the  Times  is failing to face up to one crucial reason: that it has lost faith in Americans, too.\nFor now, to assert that the  Times  plays by the same rules it always has is to commit a hypocrisy that is transparent to conservatives, dangerous to liberals and bad for the country as a whole. It makes the  Times  too easy for conservatives to dismiss and too easy for progressives to believe. The reality is that the  Times  is becoming the publication through which America\u2019s progressive elite talks to itself about an America that does not really exist.\nIt is hard to imagine a path back to saner American politics that does not traverse a common ground of shared fact. It is equally hard to imagine how America\u2019s diversity can continue to be a source of strength, rather than become a fatal flaw, if Americans are afraid or unwilling to listen to each other. I suppose it is also pretty grandiose to think you might help fix all that. But that hope, to me, is what makes journalism worth doing.\nT  he  New York Tim  es taught me how to do daily journalism. I joined the paper, for my first stint, in the pre-internet days, in an era of American journalism so different that it was almost another profession. Back in 1991 the  Times  was anxious not about a print business that was collapsing but about an industry so robust that Long Island  Newsday  was making a push into New York City. A newspaper war was under way, and the  Times  was fighting back by expanding its Metro desk, hiring reporters and opening bureaus in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx.\nMetro was the biggest news desk. New reporters had to do rotations of up to a year there to learn the culture and folkways of the paper. Baquet, surely among the greatest investigative journalists America has produced, was then in Metro. I was brought on as a probationary reporter, with a year to prove myself, and like other new hires was put through a series of assignments at the low end of the hierarchy.\nAfter about six months the Metro editor, Gerald Boyd, asked me to take a walk with him, as it turned out, to deliver a harsh lesson in  Times  ian ambition and discipline. Chain-smoking, speaking in his whispery, peculiarly high-pitched voice, he kicked my ass from one end of Times Square to the other. He had taken a chance hiring me, and he was disappointed. There was nothing special about my stories. At the rate I was going, I had no chance of making it onto the paper.\nThe next day was a Saturday, and I reached Boyd at home through the Metro desk to rattle off the speech I\u2019d endlessly rehearsed while staring at the ceiling all night. The gist was that the desk had kept me chasing small-bore stories, blah blah blah. Boyd sounded less surprised than amused to hear from me, and soon gave me a new assignment, asking me to spend three months covering the elderly, one of several new \u201cmini-beats\u201d on subjects the desk had overlooked.\nI was worried there were good reasons this particular beat had been ignored. At 26, as one of the youngest reporters on the desk, I was also not an obvious candidate for the role of house expert on the wise and grey. But Boyd assigned me to an excellent editor, Suzanne Daley, and as I began studying the city\u2019s elderly and interviewing experts and actual old people, I began to discover the rewards granted any serious reporter: that when you acknowledge how little you know, looking in at a world from the outside brings a special clarity.\nThe subject was more complicated and richer than I imagined, and every person had stories to tell. I wrote about hunger,  AIDS  and romance among the elderly, about old comedians telling old jokes to old people in senior centres. As I reported on Jews who had fled Germany to settle in Washington Heights or black Americans who had left the Jim Crow south to settle in Bushwick, Brooklyn, it dawned on me that, thanks to Boyd, I was covering the history of the world in the 20th century through the eyes of those who had lived it.\nAfter joining the permanent staff, I went, again in humbling ignorance, to Detroit, to cover the auto companies\u2019 \u2013 and the city\u2019s \u2013 struggle to recapture their former glory. And again I had a chance to learn, in this case, everything from how the largest companies in the world were run, to what it was like to work the line or the sales floor, to the struggle and dignity of life in one of America\u2019s most captivating cities. \u201cWe still have a long way to go,\u201d Rosa Parks told me, when I interviewed her after she had been robbed and beaten in her home on Detroit\u2019s west side one August night in 1994. \u201cAnd so many of our children are going astray.\u201d\nI began to write about presidential politics two years later, in 1996, and as the most inexperienced member of the team was assigned to cover a long-shot Republican candidate, Pat Buchanan. I packed a bag for a four-day reporting trip and did not return home for six weeks. Buchanan campaigned on an eccentric fusion of social conservatism and statist economic policies, along with coded appeals to racism and antisemitism, that 30 years earlier had elevated George Wallace and 20 years later would be rebranded as Trumpism. He also campaigned with conviction, humour and even joy, a combination I have rarely witnessed. As a Democrat from a family of Democrats, a graduate of Yale and a blossom of the imagined meritocracy, I had my first real chance, at Buchanan\u2019s rallies, to see the world through the eyes of stalwart opponents of abortion, immigration and the relentlessly rising tide of modernity.\nThe task of making the world intelligible was even greater in my first foreign assignment. I arrived in Jerusalem a week before the attacks of September 11th 2001, just after the second intifada had broken out. I had been to the Middle East just once, as a White House reporter covering President Bill Clinton. \u201cWell, in at the deep end,\u201d the foreign editor, Roger Cohen, told me before I left. To spend time with the perpetrators and victims of violence in the Middle East, to listen hard to the reciprocal and reinforcing stories of new and ancient grievances, is to confront the tragic truth that there can be justice on more than one side of a conflict. More than ever, it seemed to me that a reporter gave up something in renouncing the taking of sides: possibly the moral high ground, certainly the psychological satisfaction of righteous anger.\nBut there was a compensating moral and psychological privilege that came with aspiring to journalistic neutrality and open-mindedness, despised as they might understandably be by partisans. Unlike the duelling politicians and advocates of all kinds, unlike the corporate chieftains and their critics, unlike even the sainted non-profit workers, you did not have to pretend things were simpler than they actually were. You did not have to go along with everything that any tribe said. You did not have to pretend that the good guys, much as you might have respected them, were right about everything, or that the bad guys, much as you might have disdained them, never had a point. You did not, in other words, ever have to lie.\nThis fundamental honesty was vital for readers, because it equipped them to make better, more informed judgments about the world. Sometimes it might shock or upset them by failing to conform to their picture of reality. But it also granted them the respect of acknowledging that they were able to work things out for themselves.\nWhat a gift it was to be taught and trusted as I was by my editors \u2013 to be a reporter with licence to ask anyone anything, to experience the whole world as a school and every source and subject as a teacher. I left after 15 years, in 2006, when I had the chance to become editor of the  Atlantic  . Rather than starting out on yet another beat at the  Times  , I felt ready to put my experience to work and ambitious for the responsibility to shape coverage myself. It was also obvious how much the internet was changing journalism. I was eager to figure out how to use it, and anxious about being at the mercy of choices by others, in a time not just of existential peril for the industry, but maybe of opportunity.\nThe  Atlantic  did not aspire to the same role as the  Times  . It did not promise to serve up the news of the day without any bias. But it was to opinion journalism what the  Times  \u2019s reporting was supposed to be to news: honest and open to the world. The question was what the magazine\u2019s 19th-century claim of intellectual independence \u2013 to be \u201cof no party or clique\u201d \u2013 should mean in the digital era.\nThose were the glory days of the blog, and we hit on the idea of creating a living op-ed page, a collective of bloggers with different points of view but a shared intellectual honesty who would argue out the meaning of the news of the day. They were brilliant, gutsy writers, and their disagreements were deep enough that I used to joke that my main work as editor was to prevent fistfights.\nThe lessons we learned from adapting the  Atlantic  to the internet washed back into print. Under its owner, David Bradley, my colleagues and I distilled our purpose as publishing big arguments about big ideas. We made some mistakes \u2013 that goes along with any serious journalism ambitious to make a change, and to embrace change itself \u2013 but we also began producing some of the most important work in American journalism: Nicholas Carr on whether Google was \u201cmaking us stupid\u201d; Hanna Rosin on \u201cthe end of men\u201d; Taylor Branch on \u201cthe shame of college sports\u201d; Ta-Nehisi Coates on \u201cthe case for reparations\u201d; Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt on \u201cthe coddling of the American mind\u201d.\nI was starting to see some effects of the new campus politics within the  Atlantic  . A promising new editor had created a digital form for aspiring freelancers to fill out, and she wanted to ask them to disclose their racial and sexual identity. Why? Because, she said, if we were to write about the trans community, for example, we would ask a trans person to write the story. There was a good argument for that, I acknowledged, and it sometimes might be the right answer. But as I thought about the old people, auto workers and abortion opponents I had learned from, I told her there was also an argument for correspondents who brought an outsider\u2019s ignorance, along with curiosity and empathy, to the story.\nA journalism that starts out assuming it knows the answers, it seemed to me then, and seems even more so to me now, can be far less valuable to the reader than a journalism that starts out with a humbling awareness that it knows nothing. \u201cIn truly effective thinking\u201d, Walter Lippmann wrote 100 years ago in \u201cPublic Opinion\u201d, \u201cthe prime necessity is to liquidate judgments, regain an innocent eye, disentangle feelings, be curious and open-hearted.\u201d Alarmed by the shoddy journalism of his day, Lippmann was calling for journalists to struggle against their ignorance and assumptions in order to help Americans resist the increasingly sophisticated tools of propagandists. As the  Atlantic  made its digital transition, one thing I preached was that we could not cling to any tradition or convention, however hallowed, for its own sake, but only if it was relevant to the needs of readers today. In the age of the internet it is hard even for a child to sustain an \u201cinnocent eye\u201d, but the alternative for journalists remains as dangerous as ever, to become propagandists. America has more than enough of those already.\nWhat we did together at the  Atlantic  worked. We dramatically increased the magazine\u2019s audience and influence while making it profitable for the first time in generations. After I had spent ten years as editor, the last few as co-president, the publisher, A.G. Sulzberger\u2019s father, also an Arthur Sulzberger, asked me to return to the  Times  as editorial-page editor.\nHis offer, I thought, would give me the chance to do the kind of journalism I loved with more resources and greater effect. The freedom Opinion had to experiment with voice and point of view meant that it would be more able than the  Times  newsroom to take advantage of the tools of digital journalism, from audio to video to graphics. Opinion writers could also break out of limiting print conventions and do more in-depth, reported columns and editorials. Though the Opinion department, which then had about 100 staff, was a fraction the size of the newsroom, with more than 1,300, Opinion\u2019s work had outsized reach. Most important, the  Times  , probably more than any other American institution, could influence the way society approached debate and engagement with opposing views. If  Times  Opinion demonstrated the same kind of intellectual courage and curiosity that my colleagues at the  Atlantic  had shown, I hoped, the rest of the media would follow.\nNo doubt Sulzberger\u2019s offer also appealed not just to my loyalty to the  Times  , but to my ambition as well. I would report directly to the publisher, and I was immediately seen, inside and outside the paper, as a candidate for the top job. I had hoped being in Opinion would exempt me from the infamous political games of the newsroom, but it did not, and no doubt my old colleagues felt I was playing such games myself. Fairly quickly, though, I realised two things: first, that if I did my job as I thought it should be done, and as the Sulzbergers said they wanted me to do it, I would be too polarising internally ever to lead the newsroom; second, that I did not want that job, though no one but my wife believed me when I said that.\nIt was 2016, a presidential-election year, and I had been gone from the  Times  for a decade. Although many of my old colleagues had also left in the interim and the  Times  had moved into a new glass-and-steel tower, I otherwise had little idea how much things had changed. When I looked around the Opinion department, change was not what I perceived. Excellent writers and editors were doing excellent work. But the department\u2019s journalism was consumed with politics and foreign affairs in an era when readers were also fascinated by changes in technology, business, science and culture.\nThe Opinion department mocked the paper\u2019s claim to value diversity. It did not have a single black editor. The large staff of op-ed editors contained only a couple of women. Although the 11 columnists were individually admirable, only two of them were women and only one was a person of colour. (The  Times  had not appointed a black columnist until the 1990s, and had only employed two in total.) Not only did they all focus on politics and foreign affairs, but during the 2016 campaign, no columnist shared, in broad terms, the worldview of the ascendant progressives of the Democratic Party, incarnated by Bernie Sanders. And only two were conservative.\nThis last fact was of particular concern to the elder Sulzberger. He told me the  Times  needed more conservative voices, and that its own editorial line had become predictably left-wing. \u201cToo many liberals,\u201d read my notes about the Opinion line-up from a meeting I had with him and Mark Thompson, then the chief executive, as I was preparing to rejoin the paper. \u201cEven conservatives are liberals\u2019 idea of a conservative.\u201d The last note I took from that meeting was: \u201cCan\u2019t ignore 150m conservative Americans.\u201d\nWith my Opinion colleagues, I set out to deal with this long list of needs. I restructured the department, changing everybody\u2019s role and, using buyouts, changing people as well. It was too much, too fast; it rocked the department, and my colleagues and I made mistakes amid the turmoil, including one that brought a libel suit from John McCain\u2019s vice-presidential running-mate, Sarah Palin, dismissed twice by a judge and once by a jury but endlessly appealed on procedural grounds. Yet we also did more in four years to diversify the line-up of writers by identity, ideology and expertise than the  Times  had in the previous century; we published more ambitious projects than Opinion had ever attempted. We won two Pulitzer prizes in four years \u2013 as many as the department had in the previous 20.\nAs I knew from my time at the  Atlantic,  this kind of structural transformation can be frightening and even infuriating for those understandably proud of things as they are. It is hard on everyone. But experience at the  Atlantic  also taught me that pursuing new ways of doing journalism in pursuit of venerable institutional principles created enthusiasm for change. I expected that same dynamic to allay concerns at the  Times  .\nIn that same statement in 1896, after committing the  Times  to pursue the news without fear or favour, Ochs promised to \u201cinvite intelligent discussion from all shades of opinion\u201d. So adding new voices, some more progressive and others more conservative, and more journalists of diverse identities and backgrounds, fulfilled the paper\u2019s historic purpose. If Opinion published a wider range of views, it would help frame a set of shared arguments that corresponded to, and drew upon, the set of shared facts coming from the newsroom. On the right and left, America\u2019s elites now talk within their tribes, and get angry or contemptuous on those occasions when they happen to overhear the other conclave. If they could be coaxed to agree what they were arguing about, and the rules by which they would argue about it, opinion journalism could serve a foundational need of the democracy by fostering diverse and inclusive debate. Who could be against that?\nOut of naivety or arrogance, I was slow to recognise that at the  Times  , unlike at the  Atlantic  , these values were no longer universally accepted, let alone esteemed. When I first took the job, I felt some days as if I\u2019d parachuted onto one of those Pacific islands still held by Japanese soldiers who didn\u2019t know that the world beyond the waves had changed. Eventually, it sank in that my snotty joke was actually on me: I was the one ignorantly fighting a battle that was already lost. The old liberal embrace of inclusive debate that reflected the country\u2019s breadth of views had given way to a new intolerance for the opinions of roughly half of American voters. New progressive voices were celebrated within the  Times  . But in contrast to the  Wall Street Journal  and the  Washington Post,  conservative voices \u2013 even eloquent anti-Trump conservative voices \u2013 were despised, regardless of how many leftists might surround them. (President Trump himself submitted one op-ed during my time, but we could not raise it to our standards \u2013 his people would not agree to the edits we asked for.)\nAbout a year after the 2016 election, the  Times  newsroom published a profile of a man from Ohio who had attended the rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, at which a white nationalist drove his car into a crowd of protesters, killing one. It was a terrifying piece. The man had four cats, listened to National Public Radio, and had registered at Target for a muffin pan before his recent wedding. In exploring his evolution from \u201cvaguely leftist rock musician to ardent libertarian to fascist activist\u201d the article rang an alarm about how \u201cthe election of President Donald Trump helped open a space for people like him\u201d.\nThe profile was in keeping with the  Times  \u2019s tradition of confronting readers with the confounding reality of the world around them. After the 9/11 attacks, as the bureau chief in Jerusalem, I spent a lot of time in the Gaza Strip interviewing Hamas leaders, recruiters and foot soldiers, trying to understand and describe their murderous ideology. Some readers complained that I was providing a platform for terrorists, but there was never any objection from within the  Times  . (Nor did it occur to me to complain that by publishing op-eds critical of Hamas the Opinion department was putting my life in danger.) Our role, we knew, was to help readers understand such threats, and this required empathetic \u2013 not sympathetic \u2013 reporting. This is not an easy distinction but good reporters make it: they learn to understand and communicate the sources and nature of a toxic ideology without justifying it, much less advocating it.\nToday\u2019s newsroom turns that moral logic on its head, at least when it comes to fellow Americans. Unlike the views of Hamas, the views of many Americans have come to seem dangerous to engage in the absence of explicit condemnation. Focusing on potential perpetrators \u2013 \u201cplatforming\u201d them by explaining rather than judging their views \u2013 is believed to empower them to do more harm. After the profile of the Ohio man was published, media Twitter lit up with attacks on the article as \u201cnormalising\u201d Nazism and white nationalism, and the  Times  convulsed internally. The  Times  wound up publishing a cringing editor\u2019s note that hung the writer out to dry and approvingly quoted some of the criticism, including a tweet from a  Washington Post  opinion editor asking, \u201cInstead of long, glowing profiles of Nazis/White nationalists, why don\u2019t we profile the victims of their ideologies\u201d? The  Times  did profile the victims of such ideologies; and the very headline of the piece \u2013 \u201cA Voice of Hate in America\u2019s Heartland\u201d \u2013 undermined the claim that it was \u201cglowing\u201d. But the  Times  lacked the confidence to defend its own work. (As it happens, being platformed did not do much to increase the power of that Ohio man. He, his wife and his brother lost their jobs and the newly married couple lost the home intended for their muffin pan.)\nThe editor\u2019s note paraded the principle of publishing such pieces, saying it was important to \u201cshed more light, not less, on the most extreme corners of American life\u201d. But less light is what the readers got. As a reporter in the newsroom, you\u2019d have to have been an idiot after that explosion to attempt such a profile. Empathetic reporting about Trump supporters became even more rare. It became a clich\u00e9 among influential left-wing columnists and editors that blinkered political reporters interviewed a few Trump supporters in diners and came away suckered into thinking there was something besides racism that could explain anyone\u2019s support for the man.\nI failed to take the hint. As the first anniversary of Trump\u2019s inauguration approached, the editors who compile letters to the  Times  , part of my department, had put out a request to readers who supported the president to say what they thought of him now. The results had some nuance. \u201cYes, he is embarrassing,\u201d wrote one reader. \u201cYes, he picks unnecessary fights. But he also pushed tax reform through, has largely defeated  ISIS  in Iraq,\u201d and so forth. After a year spent publishing editorials attacking Trump and his policies, I thought it would be a demonstration of  Times  ian open-mindedness to give his supporters their say. Also, I thought the letters were interesting, so I turned over the entire editorial page to the Trump letters.\nI wasn\u2019t surprised that we got some criticism on Twitter. But I was astonished by the fury of my  Times  colleagues. I found myself facing an angry internal town hall, trying to justify what to me was an obvious journalistic decision. During the session, one of the newsroom\u2019s journalists demanded to know when I would publish a page of letters from Barack Obama\u2019s supporters. I stammered out some kind of answer. The question just didn\u2019t make sense to me. Pretty much every day we published letters from people who supported Obama and criticised Trump. Didn\u2019t he know that Obama wasn\u2019t president any more? Didn\u2019t he think other  Times  readers should understand the sources of Trump\u2019s support? Didn\u2019t he also see it was a wonderful thing that some Trump supporters did not just dismiss the  Times  as fake news, but still believed in it enough to respond thoughtfully to an invitation to share their views?\nAnd if the  Times  could not bear to publish the views of Americans who supported Trump, why should it be surprised that those voters would not trust it? Two years later, in 2020, Baquet acknowledged that in 2016 the  Times  had failed to take seriously the idea that Trump could become president partly because it failed to send its reporters out into America to listen to voters and understand \u201cthe turmoil in the country\u201d. And, he continued, the  Times  still did not understand the views of many Americans. \u201cOne of the great puzzles of 2016 remains a great puzzle,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy did millions and millions of Americans vote for a guy who\u2019s such an unusual candidate?\u201d Speaking four months before we published the Cotton op-ed, he said that to argue that the views of such voters should not appear in the  Times  was \u201cnot journalistic\u201d.\nConservative arguments in the Opinion pages reliably started uproars within the  Times  . Sometimes I would hear directly from colleagues who had the grace to confront me with their concerns; more often they would take to the company\u2019s Slack channels or Twitter to advertise their distress in front of each other. By contrast, in my four years as Opinion editor, I received just two complaints from newsroom staff about pieces we published from the left. When I was visiting one of the  Times  \u2019s West Coast bureaus, a reporter pulled me aside to say he worried that a liberal columnist was engaged in ad hominem attacks; a reporter in the Washington bureau wrote to me to object to an op-ed piece questioning the value of protecting free speech for right-wing groups.\nThis environment of enforced group-think, inside and outside the paper, was hard even on liberal opinion writers. One left-of-centre columnist told me that he was reluctant to appear in the New York office for fear of being accosted by colleagues. (An internal survey shortly after I left the paper found that barely half the staff, within an enterprise ostensibly devoted to telling the truth, agreed \u201cthere is a free exchange of views in this company\u201d and \u201cpeople are not afraid to say what they really think\u201d.) Even columnists with impeccable leftist bona fides recoiled from tackling subjects when their point of view might depart from progressive orthodoxy. I once complimented a long-time, left-leaning Opinion writer over a column criticising Democrats in Congress for doing something stupid. Trying to encourage more such journalism and thus less such stupidity, I remarked that this kind of argument had more influence than yet another Trump-is-a-devil column. \u201cI know,\u201d he replied, ruefully. \u201cBut Twitter hates it.\u201d\nThe bias had become so pervasive, even in the senior editing ranks of the newsroom, as to be unconscious. Trying to be helpful, one of the top newsroom editors urged me to start attaching trigger warnings to pieces by conservatives. It had not occurred to him how this would stigmatise certain colleagues, or what it would say to the world about the  Times  \u2019s own bias. By their nature, information bubbles are powerfully self-reinforcing, and I think many  Times  staff have little idea how closed their world has become, or how far they are from fulfilling their compact with readers to show the world \u201cwithout fear or favour\u201d. And sometimes the bias was explicit: one newsroom editor told me that, because I was publishing more conservatives, he felt he needed to push his own department further to the left.\nThe  Times  \u2019s failure to honour its own stated principles of openness to a range of views was particularly hard on the handful of conservative writers, some of whom would complain about being flyspecked and abused by colleagues. One day when I relayed a conservative\u2019s concern about double standards to Sulzberger, he lost his patience. He told me to inform the complaining conservative that that\u2019s just how it was: there was a double standard and he should get used to it. A publication that promises its readers to stand apart from politics should not have different standards for different writers based on their politics. But I delivered the message. There are many things I regret about my tenure as editorial-page editor. That is the only act of which I am ashamed.\nA  s I realised how different the new  Times  had become from the old one that trained me, I began to think of myself not as a benighted veteran on a remote island, but as Rip Van Winkle. I had left one newspaper, had a pleasant dream for ten years, and returned to a place I barely recognised. The new  New York Times  was the product of two shocks \u2013 sudden collapse, and then sudden success. The paper almost went bankrupt during the financial crisis, and the ensuing panic provoked a crisis of confidence among its leaders. Digital competitors like the  HuffPost  were gaining readers and winning plaudits within the media industry as innovative. They were the cool kids;  Times  folk were ink-stained wrinklies.\nIn its panic, the  Times  bought out experienced reporters and editors and began hiring journalists from publications like the  HuffPost  who were considered \u201cdigital natives\u201d because they had never worked in print. This hiring quickly became easier, since most digital publications financed by venture capital turned out to be bad businesses. The advertising that was supposed to fund them flowed instead to the giant social-media companies. The  HuffPost  s and  Buzzfeed  s began to decay, and the  Times  \u2019s subscriptions and staff began to grow.\nI have been lucky in my own career to move between local and national and international journalism, newspapers and magazines, opinion and news, and the print and digital realms. I was even luckier in these various roles to have editors with a profound understanding of their particular form and a sense of duty about teaching it. The wipeout of local papers and the desperate transformation of survivors like the  Times  have left young reporters today with fewer such opportunities.\nThough they might have lacked deep or varied reporting backgrounds, some of the  Times  \u2019s new hires brought skills in video and audio; others were practised at marketing themselves \u2013 building their brands, as journalists now put it \u2013 in social media. Some were brilliant and fiercely honest, in keeping with the old aspirations of the paper. But, critically, the  Times  abandoned its practice of acculturation, including those months-long assignments on Metro covering cops and crime or housing. Many new hires who never spent time in the streets went straight into senior writing and editing roles. Meanwhile, the paper began pushing out its print-era salespeople and hiring new ones, and also hiring hundreds of engineers to build its digital infrastructure. All these recruits arrived with their own notions of the purpose of the  Times  . To me, publishing conservatives helped fulfil the paper\u2019s mission; to them, I think, it betrayed that mission.\nAnd then, to the shock and horror of the newsroom, Trump won the presidency. In his article for  Columbia Journalism Review  , Sulzberger cites the  Times  \u2019s failure to take Trump\u2019s chances seriously as an example of how \u201cprematurely shutting down inquiry and debate\u201d can allow \u201cconventional wisdom to ossify in a way that blinds society.\u201d Many  Times  staff members \u2013 scared, angry \u2013 assumed the  Times  was supposed to help lead the resistance. Anxious for growth, the  Times  \u2019s marketing team implicitly endorsed that idea, too.\nAs the number of subscribers ballooned, the marketing department tracked their expectations, and came to a nuanced conclusion. More than 95% of  Times  subscribers described themselves as Democrats or independents, and a vast majority of them believed the  Times  was also liberal. A similar majority applauded that bias; it had become \u201ca selling point\u201d, reported one internal marketing memo. Yet at the same time, the marketers concluded, subscribers wanted to believe that the  Times  was independent.\nWhen you think about it, this contradiction resolves itself easily. It is human nature to want to see your bias confirmed; however, it is also human nature to want to be reassured that your bias is not just a bias, but is endorsed by journalism that is \u201cfair and balanced\u201d, as a certain Murdoch-owned cable-news network used to put it. As that memo argued, even if the  Times  was seen as politically to the left, it was critical to its brand also to be seen as broadening its readers\u2019 horizons, and that required \u201ca perception of independence\u201d.\nPerception is one thing, and actual independence another. Readers could cancel their subscriptions if the  Times  challenged their worldview by reporting the truth without regard to politics. As a result, the  Times  \u2019s long-term civic value was coming into conflict with the paper\u2019s short-term shareholder value. As the cable networks have shown, you can build a decent business by appealing to the millions of Americans who comprise one of the partisan tribes of the electorate. The  Times  has every right to pursue the commercial strategy that makes it the most money. But leaning into a partisan audience creates a powerful dynamic. Nobody warned the new subscribers to the  Times  that it might disappoint them by reporting truths that conflicted with their expectations. When your product is \u201cindependent journalism\u201d, that commercial strategy is tricky, because too much independence might alienate your audience, while too little can lead to charges of hypocrisy that strike at the heart of the brand.\nIt became one of Dean Baquet\u2019s frequent mordant jokes that he missed the old advertising-based business model, because, compared with subscribers, advertisers felt so much less sense of ownership over the journalism. I recall his astonishment, fairly early in the Trump administration, after  Times  reporters conducted an interview with Trump. Subscribers were angry about the questions the  Times  had asked. It was as if they\u2019d only be satisfied, Baquet said, if the reporters leaped across the desk and tried to wring the president\u2019s neck. The  Times  was slow to break it to its readers that there was less to Trump\u2019s ties to Russia than they were hoping, and more to Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop, that Trump might be right that covid came from a Chinese lab, that masks were not always effective against the virus, that shutting down schools for many months was a bad idea.\nIn my experience, reporters overwhelmingly support Democratic policies and candidates. They are generally also motivated by a desire for a more just world. Neither of those tendencies are new. But there has been a sea change over the past ten years in how journalists think about pursuing justice. The reporters\u2019 creed used to have its foundation in liberalism, in the classic philosophical sense. The exercise of a reporter\u2019s curiosity and empathy, given scope by the constitutional protections of free speech, would equip readers with the best information to form their own judgments. The best ideas and arguments would win out. The journalist\u2019s role was to be a sworn witness; the readers\u2019 role was to be judge and jury. In its idealised form, journalism was lonely, prickly, unpopular work, because it was only through unrelenting scepticism and questioning that society could advance. If everyone the reporter knew thought X, the reporter\u2019s role was to ask: why X?\nIlliberal journalists have a different philosophy, and they have their reasons for it. They are more concerned with group rights than individual rights, which they regard as a bulwark for the privileges of white men. They have seen the principle of free speech used to protect right-wing outfits like  Project Veritas  and  Breitbart News  and are uneasy with it. They had their suspicions of their fellow citizens\u2019 judgment confirmed by Trump\u2019s election, and do not believe readers can be trusted with potentially dangerous ideas or facts. They are not out to achieve social justice as the knock-on effect of pursuing truth; they want to pursue it head-on. The term \u201cobjectivity\u201d to them is code for ignoring the poor and weak and cosying up to power, as journalists often have done.\nAnd they do not just want to be part of the cool crowd. They need to be. To be more valued by their peers and their contacts \u2013 and hold sway over their bosses \u2013 they need a lot of followers in social media. That means they must be seen to applaud the right sentiments of the right people in social media. The journalist from central casting used to be a loner, contrarian or a misfit. Now journalism is becoming another job for joiners, or, to borrow Twitter\u2019s own parlance, \u201cfollowers\u201d, a term that mocks the essence of a journalist\u2019s role.\nThis is a bit of a paradox. The new newsroom ideology seems idealistic, yet it has grown from cynical roots in academia: from the idea that there is no such thing as objective truth; that there is only narrative, and that therefore whoever controls the narrative \u2013 whoever gets to tell the version of the story that the public hears \u2013 has the whip hand. What matters, in other words, is not truth and ideas in themselves, but the power to determine both in the public mind.\nBy contrast, the old newsroom ideology seems cynical on its surface. It used to bug me that my editors at the  Times  assumed every word out of the mouth of any person in power was a lie. And the pursuit of objectivity can seem reptilian, even nihilistic, in its abjuration of a fixed position in moral contests. But the basis of that old newsroom approach was idealistic: the notion that power ultimately lies in truth and ideas, and that the citizens of a pluralistic democracy, not leaders of any sort, must be trusted to judge both.\nOur role in  Times  Opinion, I used to urge my colleagues, was not to tell people what to think, but to help them fulfil their desire to think for themselves. It seems to me that putting the pursuit of truth, rather than of justice, at the top of a publication\u2019s hierarchy of values also better serves not just truth but justice, too: over the long term journalism that is not also sceptical of the advocates of any form of justice and the programmes they put forward, and that does not struggle honestly to understand and explain the sources of resistance, will not assure that those programmes will work, and it also has no legitimate claim to the trust of reasonable people who see the world very differently. Rather than advance understanding and durable change, it provokes backlash.\nThe impatience within the newsroom with such old ways was intensified by the generational failure of the  Times  to hire and promote women and non-white people, black people in particular. In the 1990s, and into the early part of this century, when I worked in the high-profile Washington bureau of the  Times  , usually at most two of the dozens of journalists stationed there were black. Before Baquet became executive editor, the highest-ranked black journalist at the  Times  had been my old Metro editor, Gerald Boyd. He rose to become managing editor before A.G. Sulzberger\u2019s father pushed him out, along with the executive editor, Howell Raines, when a black reporter named Jayson Blair was discovered to be a fabulist. Boyd was said to have protected Blair, an accusation he denied and attributed to racism.\nThe accusation against Boyd never made sense to me. In my experience he was even harder on black and brown reporters than he was on us white people. He understood better than anyone what it would take for them to succeed at the  Times  . \u201cThe  Times  was a place where blacks felt they had to convince their white peers that they were good enough to be there,\u201d he wrote in his heartbreaking memoir, published posthumously. He died in 2006 of lung cancer, three years after he was discarded.\nPay attention if you are white at the  Times  and you will hear black editors speak of hiring consultants at their own expense to figure out how to get white staff to respect them. You might hear how a black journalist, passing through the newsroom, was asked by a white colleague whether he was the \u201ctelephone guy\u201d sent to fix his extension. I certainly never got asked a question like that. Among the experienced journalists at the  Times  , black journalists were least likely, I thought, to exhibit fragility and herd behaviour.\nAs wave after wave of pain and outrage swept through the  Times  , over a headline that was not damning enough of Trump or someone\u2019s obnoxious tweets, I came to think of the people who were fragile, the ones who were caught up in Slack or Twitter storms, as people who had only recently discovered that they were white and were still getting over the shock. Having concluded they had got ahead by working hard, it has been a revelation to them that their skin colour was not just part of the wallpaper of American life, but a source of power, protection and advancement. They may know a lot about television, or real estate, or how to edit audio files, but their work does not take them into shelters, or police precincts, or the homes of people who see the world very differently. It has never exposed them to live fire. Their idea of violence includes vocabulary.\nI share the bewilderment that so many people could back Trump, given the things he says and does, and that makes me want to understand why they do: the breadth and diversity of his support suggests not just racism is at work. Yet these elite, well-meaning  Times  staff cannot seem to stretch the empathy they are learning to extend to people with a different skin colour to include those, of whatever race, who have different politics.\nThe digital natives were nevertheless valuable, not only for their skills but also because they were excited for the  Times  to embrace its future. That made them important allies of the editorial and business leaders as they sought to shift the  Times  to digital journalism and to replace staff steeped in the ways of print. Partly for that reason, and partly out of fear, the leadership indulged internal attacks on  Times  journalism, despite pleas from me and others, to them and the company as a whole, that  Times  folk should treat each other with more respect. My colleagues and I in Opinion came in for a lot of the scorn, but we were not alone. Correspondents in the Washington bureau and political reporters would take a beating, too, when they were seen as committing sins like \u201cfalse balance\u201d because of the nuance in their stories.\nMy fellow editorial and commercial leaders were well aware of how the culture of the institution had changed. As delighted as they were by the  Times  \u2019s digital transformation they were not blind to the ideological change that came with it. They were unhappy with the bullying and group-think; we often discussed such cultural problems in the weekly meetings of the executive committee, composed of the top editorial and business leaders, including the publisher. Inevitably, these bitch sessions would end with someone saying a version of: \u201cWell, at some point we have to tell them this is what we believe in as a newspaper, and if they don\u2019t like it they should work somewhere else.\u201d It took me a couple of years to realise that this moment was never going to come.\nMore than 30 years ago, a young political reporter named Todd Purdum tremulously asked an all-staff meeting what would be done about the \u201cclimate of fear\u201d within the newsroom in which reporters felt intimidated by their bosses? The moment immediately entered  Times  lore. There is a lot not to miss about the days when editors like Boyd could strike terror in young reporters like me and Purdum. But the pendulum has swung so far in the other direction that editors now tremble before their reporters and even their interns. \u201cI miss the old climate of fear,\u201d Baquet used to say with a smile, in another of his barbed jokes.\nD  uring the first meeting of the  Times  board of directors that I attended, in 2016, Baquet and I hosted a joint question-and-answer session. At one point, Baquet, musing about how the  Times  was changing, observed that one of the newsroom\u2019s cultural critics had become the paper\u2019s best political-opinion columnist. Taking this musing one step further, I then noted that this raised an obvious question: why did the paper still have an Opinion department separate from the newsroom, with its own editor reporting directly to the publisher? If the newsroom was publishing the best opinion journalism at the paper \u2013 if it was publishing opinion at all \u2013 why did the  Times  maintain a separate department that falsely claimed to have a monopoly on such journalism?\nEveryone laughed. But I meant it, and I wish I\u2019d pursued my point and talked myself out of the job. This contest over control of opinion journalism within the  Times  was not just a bureaucratic turf battle (though it was that, too). The newsroom\u2019s embrace of opinion journalism has compromised the  Times  \u2019s independence, misled its readers and fostered a culture of intolerance and conformity.\nThe Opinion department is a relic of the era when the  Times  enforced a line between news and opinion journalism. Editors in the newsroom did not touch opinionated copy, lest they be contaminated by it, and opinion journalists and editors kept largely to their own, distant floor within the  Times  building. Such fastidiousness could seem excessive, but it enforced an ethos that  Times  reporters owed their readers an unceasing struggle against bias in the news. But by the time I returned as editorial-page editor, more opinion columnists and critics were writing for the newsroom than for Opinion. As at the cable news networks, the boundaries between commentary and news were disappearing, and readers had little reason to trust that  Times  journalists were resisting rather than indulging their biases.\nThe  Times  newsroom had added more cultural critics, and, as Baquet noted, they were free to opine about politics. Departments across the  Times  newsroom had also begun appointing their own \u201ccolumnists\u201d, without stipulating any rules that might distinguish them from columnists in Opinion. It became a running joke. Every few months, some poor editor in the newsroom or Opinion would be tasked with writing up guidelines that would distinguish the newsroom\u2019s opinion journalists from those of Opinion, and every time they would ultimately throw up their hands.\nI remember how shaken A.G. Sulzberger was one day when he was cornered by a cultural critic who had got wind that such guardrails might be put in place. The critic insisted he was an opinion writer, just like anyone in the Opinion department, and he would not be reined in. He wasn\u2019t. (I checked to see if, since I left the  Times  , it had developed guidelines explaining the difference, if any, between a news columnist and opinion columnist. The paper\u2019s spokeswoman, Danielle Rhoades Ha, did not respond to the question.)\nThe internet rewards opinionated work and, as news editors felt increasing pressure to generate page views, they began not just hiring more opinion writers but also running their own versions of opinionated essays by outside voices \u2013 historically, the province of Opinion\u2019s op-ed department. Yet because the paper continued to honour the letter of its old principles, none of this work could be labelled \u201copinion\u201d (it still isn\u2019t). After all, it did not come from the Opinion department. And so a newsroom technology columnist might call for, say, unionisation of the Silicon Valley workforce, as one did, or an outside writer might argue in the business section for reparations for slavery, as one did, and to the average reader their work would appear indistinguishable from  Times  news articles.\nBy similarly circular logic, the newsroom\u2019s opinion journalism breaks another of the  Times  \u2019s commitments to its readers. Because the newsroom officially does not do opinion \u2013 even though it openly hires and publishes opinion journalists \u2013 it feels free to ignore Opinion\u2019s mandate to provide a diversity of views. When I was editorial-page editor, there were a couple of newsroom columnists whose politics were not obvious. But the other newsroom columnists, and the critics, read as passionate progressives.\nI urged Baquet several times to add a conservative to the newsroom roster of cultural critics. That would serve the readers by diversifying the  Times  \u2019s analysis of culture, where the paper\u2019s left-wing bias had become most blatant, and it would show that the newsroom also believed in restoring the  Times  \u2019s commitment to taking conservatives seriously. He said this was a good idea, but he never acted on it. I couldn\u2019t help trying the idea out on one of the paper\u2019s top cultural editors, too: he told me he did not think  Times  readers would be interested in that point of view.\nAs the  Times  tried to compete for more readers online, homogenous opinion was spreading through the newsroom in other ways. News desks were urging reporters to write in the first person and to use more \u201cvoice\u201d, but few newsroom editors had experience in handling that kind of journalism, and no one seemed certain where \u201cvoice\u201d stopped and \u201copinion\u201d began. The  Times  magazine, meanwhile, became a crusading progressive publication. Baquet liked to say the magazine was Switzerland, by which he meant that it sat between the newsroom and Opinion. But it reported only to the news side. Its work was not labelled as opinion and it was free to omit conservative viewpoints.\nThis creep of politics into the newsroom\u2019s journalism helped the  Times  beat back some of its new challengers, at least those on the left. Competitors like  Vox  and the  HuffPost  were blending leftish politics with reporting and writing it up conversationally in the first person. Imitating their approach, along with hiring some of their staff, helped the  Times  repel them. But it came at a cost. The rise of opinion journalism over the past 15 years changed the newsroom\u2019s coverage and its culture. The tiny redoubt of never-Trump conservatives in Opinion is swamped daily not only by the many progressives in that department but their reinforcements among the critics, columnists and magazine writers in the newsroom. They are generally excellent, but their homogeneity means  Times  readers are being served a very restricted range of views, some of them presented as straight news by a publication that still holds itself out as independent of any politics. And because the critics, newsroom columnists and magazine writers are the newsroom\u2019s most celebrated journalists, they have disproportionate influence over the paper\u2019s culture.\nAnd yet the  Times  insists to the public that nothing has changed. By saying that it still holds itself to the old standard of strictly separating its news and opinion journalists, the paper leads its readers further into the trap of thinking that what they are reading is independent and impartial \u2013 and this misleads them about their country\u2019s centre of political and cultural gravity. \u201cEven though each day\u2019s opinion pieces are typically among our most popular journalism and our columnists are among our most trusted voices, we believe opinion is secondary to our primary mission of reporting and should represent only a portion of a healthy news diet,\u201d Sulzberger wrote in the  Columbia Journalism Review.  \u201cFor that reason, we\u2019ve long kept the Opinion department intentionally small \u2013 it represents well under a tenth of our journalistic staff \u2013 and ensured that its editorial decision-making is walled off from the newsroom.\u201d\nWhen I was editorial-page editor, Sulzberger, who declined to be interviewed on the record for this article, worried a great deal about the breakdown in the boundaries between news and opinion. At one town hall, he was confronted by a staffer upset that we in Opinion had begun doing more original reporting, which was a priority for me. Sulzberger replied he was much less worried about reporting in the Opinion coverage than by opinion in the news report \u2013 a fine moment, I thought then and think now, in his leadership. He told me once that he would like to restructure the paper to have one editor oversee all its news reporters, another all its opinion journalists and a third all its service journalists, the ones who supply guidance on buying gizmos or travelling abroad. Each of these editors would report to him. That is the kind of action the  Times  needs to take now to confront its hypocrisy and begin restoring its independence.\nThe  Times  could learn something from the  Wall Street Journal  , which has kept its journalistic poise. It has maintained a stricter separation between its news and opinion journalism, including its cultural criticism, and that has protected the integrity of its work. After I was chased out of the  Times  ,  Journal  reporters and other staff attempted a similar assault on their opinion department. Some 280 of them signed a letter listing pieces they found offensive and demanding changes in how their opinion colleagues approached their work. \u201cTheir anxieties aren\u2019t our responsibility,\u201d shrugged the  Journal  \u2019s editorial board in a note to readers after the letter was leaked. \u201cThe signers report to the news editors or other parts of the business.\u201d The editorial added, in case anyone missed the point, \u201cWe are not the  New York Times  .\u201d That was the end of it.\nUnlike the publishers of the  Journal  , however, Sulzberger is in a bind, or at least perceives himself to be. The confusion within the  Times  over its role, and the rising tide of intolerance among the reporters, the engineers, the business staff, even the subscribers \u2013 these are all problems he inherited, in more ways than one. He seems to feel constrained in confronting the paper\u2019s illiberalism by the very source of his authority. He is sensitive about the idiosyncratic way he reached the pinnacle of American news media, via his family\u2019s control of the paper\u2019s voting stock. Once, when I told him we were preparing an editorial series on nepotism within the Trump White House, he was quick to note that the  Times  was in a glass house when it came to such criticism.\nThe paradox is that in previous generations the Sulzbergers\u2019 control was the bulwark of the paper\u2019s independence. For this publisher, it seems also to be a vulnerability. He noted in the  Columbia Journalism Review  that he is \u201ca wealthy white man who succeeded a series of other wealthy white men with the same first and last name.\u201d His background, he wrote, may make him \u201cuniquely, perhaps even comically, unpersuasive\u201d in the debate over journalistic principles. That confession read like throat-clearing before his lengthy exposition of \u201cindependent journalism\u201d, and it is right for people to be aware of the blinders and biases created by their upbringing. But if he is going to instil the principles he believes in, he needs to stop worrying so much about his powers of persuasion, and start using the power he is so lucky to have.\nT  om Cotton had written two op-eds for us in Opinion, making the case for buying Greenland and defending Trump\u2019s decision to assassinate the head of the Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, General Qassem Suleimani. Adam Rubenstein, a rising talent in Opinion, had helped edit the second of these pieces. Rubenstein had brought in dozens of op-eds by then that reflected a variety of voices, ideas and politics, and had received a note of praise from Sulzberger himself, for a piece by a former congressman, Joe Walsh, a Tea Party favourite who had called for a primary challenge to Trump. But Rubenstein had a background in conservative journalism, and within the  Times  his work in soliciting pieces from conservatives had put a target on his back.\nIn early June 2020 Cotton\u2019s office pitched a piece about Twitter\u2019s curation of its platform. Cotton had tweeted that Trump should call out troops to stop the \u201canarchy, rioting and looting\u201d if \u201clocal law enforcement is overwhelmed\u201d, and Twitter had threatened to censor his account. Jim Dao, the op-ed editor, was more interested in the substance of the tweet and, via Rubenstein, asked Cotton to write an op-ed about that.\nThat was the right thing to do. Trump was starting to call for the use of troops, and on May 31st the mayor of Washington, DC, had requested that the National Guard be deployed in her city. After police gassed protesters before Trump posed for a photo in Lafayette Square on June 1st, the editorial board, which I led, weighed in against that use of force and Trump\u2019s \u201cincendiary behaviour\u201d, and the op-ed team had pieces planned for June 3rd arguing he did not have a sound basis to call out federal forces and would be wrong to do so. In keeping with the basic practice of the op-ed page, which was created to present points of view at odds with  Times  editorials, Dao owed readers the counter-argument. They also needed to know someone so influential with the president was making this argument, and how he was making it.\nI knew the piece was coming, and that Dao had asked for substantive revisions to the first draft. At the time, Rubenstein was assisting me with research for a daily newsletter I was writing, and I asked him when we met on the morning of June 3rd to make sure Cotton was distinguishing clearly between rioters and protesters. He did: \u201cA majority who seek to protest peacefully shouldn\u2019t be confused with bands of miscreants,\u201d Cotton wrote. From Cotton\u2019s perspective, it was leftist elites who were confusing the two. In the op-ed, he decried any \u201crevolting moral equivalence of rioters and looters to peaceful, law-abiding protesters\u201d.\nRubenstein also told me that in one draft Cotton had linked disapprovingly to a tweet from a  Times  reporter that could be read as expressing support for the rioters. I told Rubenstein to make sure that this link was removed. I had prohibited criticising any work, including any social-media activity, from the newsroom, unless I ran the idea by a senior newsroom editor first.\nShortly after we published the op-ed that Wednesday afternoon, some reporters tweeted their opposition to Cotton\u2019s argument. But the real action was in the  Times  \u2019s Slack channels, where reporters and other staff began not just venting but organising. They turned to the union to draw up a workplace complaint about the op-ed. At least one of the reporters who covered news media took a strong position in this internal debate: \u201cAmplifying a message that argues for MORE force only puts our own people in harm\u2019s way, and undermines the paper\u2019s commitment to their safety,\u201d this reporter argued to colleagues in Slack, going on to offer suggestions for how the union should attack the op-ed: \u201cI think it\u2019s good that a lot of us will put our names on a strong condemnation.\u201d\nThe next day, this reporter shared the byline on the  Times  story about the op-ed. That article did not mention that Cotton had distinguished between \u201cpeaceful, law-abiding protesters\u201d and \u201crioters and looters\u201d. In fact, the first sentence reported that Cotton had called for \u201cthe military to suppress protests against police violence\u201d.\nThis was \u2013 and is \u2013 wrong. You don\u2019t have to take my word for that. You can take the  Times  \u2019s. Three days later in its article on my resignation it also initially reported that Cotton had called \u201cfor military force against protesters in American cities\u201d. This time, after the article was published on the  Times  website, the editors scrambled to rewrite it, replacing \u201cmilitary force\u201d with \u201cmilitary response\u201d and \u201cprotesters\u201d with \u201ccivic unrest\u201d. That was a weaselly adjustment \u2013 Cotton wrote about criminality, not \u201cunrest\u201d \u2013 but the article at least no longer unambiguously misrepresented Cotton\u2019s argument to make it seem he was in favour of crushing democratic protest. The  Times  did not publish a correction or any note acknowledging the story had been changed.\nSeeking to influence the outcome of a story you cover, particularly without disclosing that to the reader, violates basic principles I was raised on at the  Times  . I asked the  Times  if the media reporter\u2019s behaviour was ethical. The spokeswoman, Ms Rhoades Ha, did not answer the question but instead wrote in an email that the reporter was assigned to the story after posting the messages in Slack and the \u201ceditors were unaware of those Slack messages\u201d. The reporter, apparently asked by the  Times  to write to me, immediately followed with an email that said: \u201cIn the heat of the moment, I made comments on an internal Slack channel that, as a media reporter, I should not have\u201d but that \u201cthe factual reporting I contributed to the story is not at issue.\u201d (I am not naming this journalist because I do not want to point the finger at a single reporter when, in my view, an editor should be taking responsibility for the coverage.) Ms Rhoades Ha disputes my characterisation of the after-the-fact editing of the story about my resignation. She said the editors changed the story after it was published on the website in order to \u201crefine\u201d it and \u201cadd context\u201d, and so the story did not merit a correction disclosing to the reader that changes had been made.\nI asked if it was accurate and fair to report that Cotton called for \u201cthe military to suppress protests against police violence\u201d, as the June 4th story still does. In response, Ms Rhoades Ha supplied an opinion from a  Times  lawyer which noted that Cotton called for a military presence to \u201cdeter lawbreakers\u201d. The lawyer argued that because some protesters violated curfews, failed to get permits or disperse when police ordered them to, they could be considered \u201clawbreakers\u201d, just like the rioters and looters Cotton explicitly referred to. I followed up, saying I was seeking an editorial rather than a legal opinion, and asking again whether the  Times  believed its characterisation of Cotton\u2019s argument was not just accurate, but fair. Ms Rhoades Ha again referred me to the lawyer\u2019s opinion.\nShe also defended the  Times  more broadly: \u201cThe  New York Times  believes unequivocally in the principle of independence, as has been demonstrated consistently by our journalism before and since that episode. There are countless examples of the  Times  standing strong against pressure and protest, whether from governments, companies, politicians, activist groups or even internally. In the case of the Tom Cotton op-ed, the handling of such a sensitive piece, specifically the decision to rush it into publication without key leaders having read it because it was \u201cnewsy\u201d, made it unusually vulnerable to attack. Good principles, as the Cotton op-ed demonstrated, cannot be an excuse for bad execution.\u201d\nIn retrospect what seems almost comical is that as the conflict over Cotton\u2019s op-ed unfolded within the  Times  I acted as though it was on the level, as though the staff of the  Times  would have a good-faith debate about Cotton\u2019s piece and the decision to publish it. Instead, people wanted to vent and achieve what they considered to be justice, whether through Twitter, Slack, the union or the news pages themselves. Engaging with them at all was a mistake. That first night after the op-ed was published, when I called Baquet, his sage advice was to say nothing. Give it time, he said. Let this play out. The publisher disagreed. He thought we needed to say something that night explaining why we chose to publish the piece, and so we kept heaping more logs on the fire.\nMy colleagues in Opinion, together with the  PR  team, put together a series of connected tweets describing the purpose behind publishing Cotton\u2019s op-ed. Rather than publish these tweets from the generic  Times  Opinion Twitter account, Sulzberger encouraged me to do it from my personal one, on the theory that this would humanise our defence. I doubted that would make any difference, but it was certainly my job to take responsibility. So I sent out the tweets, sticking my head in a Twitter bucket that clangs, occasionally, to this day. At the publisher\u2019s direction, I then wrote an explanation of the decision to publish the op-ed for the next day\u2019s edition of the Opinion newsletter. Reading that piece now, I think it holds up. It was not defensive and it dealt with the strongest criticisms. It concluded with a sentiment that I\u2019ve always thought journalists should bring to all their work, and which I intended as an invitation to debate. (\u201cIt is impossible to feel righteous about any of this. I know that my own view may be wrong.\u201d) But no one took me up on that.\nW  hat is worth recalling now from the bedlam of the next two days? I suppose there might be lessons for someone interested in how not to manage a corporate crisis. I began making my own mistakes that Thursday. The union condemned our publication of Cotton, for supposedly putting journalists in danger, claiming that he had called on the military \u201cto \u2018detain\u2019 and \u2018subdue\u2019 Americans protesting racism and police brutality\u201d \u2013 again, a misrepresentation of his argument. The publisher called to tell me the company was experiencing its largest sick day in history; people were turning down job offers because of the op-ed, and, he said, some people were quitting. He had been expecting for some time that the union would seek a voice in editorial decision-making; he said he thought this was the moment the union was making its move. He had clearly changed his own mind about the value of publishing the Cotton op-ed.\nI asked Dao to have our fact-checkers review the union\u2019s claims. But then I went a step further: at the publisher\u2019s request, I urged him to review the editing of the piece itself and come back to me with a list of steps we could have taken to make it better. Dao\u2019s reflex \u2013 the correct one \u2013 was to defend the piece as published. He and three other editors of varying ages, genders and races had helped edit it; it had been fact-checked, as is all our work. But I resisted, worried that we had put Sulzberger in a hard position. In Opinion we had grown accustomed to the wrath of our colleagues, but this time the publisher was in the line of fire as well.\nI told myself there was nothing false about this. There isn\u2019t an article out of the many thousands I have written or edited that I do not think, in retrospect, could have met a higher standard in some way \u2013 and Cotton\u2019s op-ed is no exception. And I thought that by saying we could have somehow made the piece better, we would dispel the heat within the  Times  but affirm the principle that it was the kind of piece we should publish. This was my last failed attempt to have the debate within the  Times  that I had been seeking for four years, about why it was important to present  Times  readers with arguments like Cotton\u2019s. The staff at the paper never wanted to have that debate. The Cotton uproar was the most extreme version of the internal reaction we faced whenever we published conservative arguments that were not simply anti-Trump. Yes, yes, of course we believe in the principle of publishing diverse views, my  Times  colleagues would say, but why  this  conservative? Why  this  argument?\nMost of the union\u2019s assertions were wrong, but in going back over the piece the fact-checker did find a minor error. Cotton had accidentally left some words from a legal opinion in quotation marks that he should have put in his own voice. Dao also dutifully itemised language that we might have softened, and said the headline, \u201cSend in the Troops\u201d should in retrospect have been made more palatable, if duller. I doubt these changes would have mattered, and to extract this list from Dao was to engage in precisely the hypocrisy I claimed to despise \u2013 that, in fact, I do despise. If Cotton needed to be held to such standards of politesse, so did everyone else. Headlines such as \u201cTom Cotton\u2019s Fascist Op-ed\u201d, the headline of a subsequent piece, should also have been tranquillised.\nAs that miserable Thursday wore on, Sulzberger, Baquet and I held a series of Zoom meetings with reporters and editors from the newsroom who wanted to discuss the op-ed. Though a handful of the participants were there to posture, these were generally constructive conversations. A couple of people, including Baquet, even had the guts to speak up in favour of publishing the op-ed. Two moments stick out. At one point, in answer to a question, Sulzberger and Baquet both said they thought the op-ed \u2013 as the  Times  union and many journalists were saying \u2013 had in fact put journalists in danger. That was the first time I realised I might be coming to the end of the road. The other was when a pop-culture reporter asked if I had read the op-ed before it was published. I said I had not. He immediately put his head down and started typing, and I should have paid attention rather than moving on to the next question. He was evidently sharing the news with the company over Slack.\nIf he had followed up, or I had, I might have explained that this was standard practice. Dao\u2019s name was on the masthead of the  New York Times  because he was in charge of the op-ed section. If I insisted on reviewing every piece, I would have been doing his job for him \u2013 and been betraying a crippling lack of trust in one of the papers\u2019 finest editors. After I departed, and other Opinion staff quit or were reassigned, the  Times  later made him Metro editor, a sign of its own continued confidence in him. Every job review I had at the  Times  urged me to step back from the daily coverage to focus on the long term. (Hilariously, one review, urging me to move faster in upending the Opinion department, instructed me to take risks and \u201cask for forgiveness not permission\u201d.)\nIt was important to me to read pieces in advance that might cause an uproar, and I had asked Dao and his deputy to alert me to any they thought would be particularly sensitive, but they did not think the Cotton piece rose to that level. I had also instituted an \u201cif-you-see-something-say-something\u201d policy in Opinion as a whole. Nobody raised a red flag with me. To be clear \u2013 I don\u2019t fault anyone for this; I mention it only as an index of how much easier it was to judge in hindsight, after publication, when a piece was explosive. In any event, if anyone had raised an alarm, I might have edited the piece differently, but that would not have changed the outcome. Given the pieces we had already published and planned to publish opposing the position Cotton argued, we would still have published it \u2013 it was, in my view at the time, the kind of viewpoint the Sulzbergers had said they wanted to see also represented in the  Times  . And the critics would hardly have been mollified had it been more persuasive.\nI learned when these meetings were over that there had been a new eruption in Slack.  Times  staff were saying that Rubenstein had been the sole editor of the op-ed. In response, Dao had gone into Slack to clarify to the entire company that he had also edited it himself. But when the  Times  posted the news article that evening, it reported, \u201cThe Op-Ed was edited by Adam Rubenstein\u201d and made no mention of Dao\u2019s statement. One of the ironies of this episode was that it was not any newsroom reporter but Rubenstein who wound up receiving death threats because of the Cotton op-ed, and it was the newsroom that put him in harm\u2019s way. I would put  Times  Opinion\u2019s standards for the editing of Cotton\u2019s op-ed up against the  Times  newsroom\u2019s standards for its coverage of the op-ed any day of the week.\nBy unhappy \u2013 but, really, also quite funny \u2013 coincidence, a meeting of the entire company had been scheduled over Zoom for the next morning. The plan had been for the newsroom to talk about its coverage of the protests. Now the only subject was going to be the op-ed. Early that morning, I got an email from Sam Dolnick, a Sulzberger cousin and a top editor at the paper, who said he felt \u201cwe\u201d \u2013 he could have only meant me \u2013 owed the whole staff \u201can apology for appearing to place an abstract idea like open debate over the value of our colleagues\u2019 lives, and their safety\u201d. He was worried that I and my colleagues had unintentionally sent a message to other people at the  Times  that: \u201cWe don\u2019t care about their full humanity and their security as much as we care about our ideas.\u201d\nLike his cousin, the publisher, Dolnick is a smart guy with a good heart, and I know he meant well. But I was staggered by his email, by how different his conception was of the role of journalism, and of my own commitment to it. Did he really think I saw this as an academic exercise, or some kind of game? My mother survived the Holocaust in Poland, and it took years for her and the remnant of our family to be admitted to the United States. Did he really think I believed ideas had no consequences for people\u2019s lives? I guess I was also fed up. I wrote to the publisher, who had been copied in on Dolnick\u2019s note.\n\u201cI know you don\u2019t like it when I talk about principles at a moment like this,\u201d I began. But I viewed the journalism I had been doing, at the  Times  and before that at the  Atlantic  , in very different terms from the ones Dolnick presumed. \u201cI don\u2019t think of our work as an abstraction without meaning for people\u2019s lives \u2013 quite the opposite,\u201d I continued. \u201cThe whole point \u2013 the reason I do this \u2013 is to have an impact on their lives to the good. I have always believed that putting ideas, including potentially dangerous one[s], out in the public is vital to ensuring they are debated and, if dangerous, discarded.\u201d It was, I argued, in \u201cedge cases like this that principles are tested\u201d, and if my position was judged wrong then \u201cI am out of step with the times.\u201d But, I concluded, \u201cI don\u2019t think of us as some kind of debating society without implications for the real world and I\u2019ve never been unmindful of my colleagues\u2019 humanity.\u201d\nSulzberger did not reply. But in the end, one thing he and I surely agree on is that I was, in fact, out of step with the  Times  . It may have raised me as a journalist \u2013 and invested so much in educating me to what were once its standards \u2013 but I did not belong there any more.\nIn retrospect, it seems clear that I was done by then. The executive committee gathered that morning to prepare, and for the first time I was not invited to join them. They had solicited questions in advance, and I got a glimpse at the list only as the company-wide meeting was about to start. I did not hear from Sulzberger, but the speechwriter who drafted many of his remarks, Alex Levy, contacted me just before the meeting began to tell me to use whatever question I got first to apologise, and at some point to acknowledge my privilege.\nA Zoom call with a couple of thousand people is a disorienting experience, particularly when many of them are not particularly mindful of your \u201cfull humanity\u201d. I do not recommend it. As my first turn to speak came up, I was still struggling with what I should apologise for. I was not going to apologise for denying my colleagues\u2019 humanity or endangering their lives. I had not done those things. I was not going to apologise for publishing the op-ed. Finally, I came up with something that felt true. I told the meeting that I was sorry for the pain that my leadership of Opinion had caused. What a pathetic thing to say. I did not think to add, because I\u2019d lost track of this truth myself by then, that opinion journalism that never causes pain is not journalism. It can\u2019t hope to move society forward.\nBaquet spoke movingly about how, as a black man, he was vulnerable in ways a white man was not when he left his apartment wearing a hoodie and a mask, to ward off covid. Speaking into the void, via the unblinking eye above my computer screen, I said I knew, as a white man, I was in a very different position. When I stepped out into the street, I was protected by my privilege. But I added that I did know what it was like to be a reporter out in the field, alone, surrounded by armed, hostile people. I knew what it was like to be shot at, and to see a fellow journalist shot in front of me. And so I took to heart the criticism that I\u2019d endangered my colleagues. I\u2019d been raised \u2013 raised at the  Times  \u2013 to believe the best way to confront ideas that some people might consider dangerous was to bring them out into the open. But I recognised that many of my colleagues thought that was wrong. And I said I would like to debate with them whether it was time to discard the old approach, and, if that was the case, what role opinion journalism should have at the  Times  .\nAs I look back at my notes of that awful day, I don\u2019t regret what I said. Even during that meeting, I was still hoping the blow-up might at last give me the chance either to win support for what I had been asked to do, or to clarify once and for all that the rules for journalism had changed at the  Times  .\nBut no one wanted to talk about that. Nor did they want to hear about all the voices of vulnerable or underprivileged people we had been showcasing in Opinion, or the ambitious new journalism we were doing. Instead, my  Times  colleagues demanded to know things such as the names of every editor who had had a role in the Cotton piece. Having seen what happened to Rubenstein I refused to tell them. A Slack channel had been set up to solicit feedback in real time during the meeting, and it was filling with hate. The meeting ran long, and finally came to a close after 90 minutes.\nOne last dismal task lay ahead. I had agreed to take the rare step of posting an \u201cEditor\u2019s Note\u201d on the Cotton op-ed describing what was supposedly wrong with it, and the publisher had asked a newsroom editor to draft it for him. Although I had urged Dao to come up with \u201cprocess\u201d criticisms, I tried to insist, as did Dao, that the note make clear the Cotton piece was within our editorial bounds. Sulzberger said he felt the  Times  could afford to be \u201csilent\u201d on that question. In the end the note went far further in repudiating the piece than I anticipated, saying it should never have been published at all. The next morning I was told to resign.\nW  hat an intense period that was, inside the  Times  and across America. In spring 2020 covid-19 chased people into their homes in fear, and then, as spring turned to summer, the murder of George Floyd brought many of them out into the streets in anger. Or maybe the emotions were the other way around. We were also angry at the virus, and at the government\u2019s handling of it, and at our employers; and we were afraid of the police, or of the rioters, or of white people or black people, Democrats or Republicans. It was a terrible moment for the country. By the traditional \u2013 and perverse \u2013 logic of journalism, that should also have made it an inspiring time to be a reporter, writer or editor. Journalists are supposed to run towards scenes that others are fleeing, towards hard truths others need to know, towards consequential ideas they would prefer to ignore.\nBut fear got all mixed up with anger inside the  Times  , too, along with a desire to act locally in solidarity with the national movement. That energy found a focus in the Cotton op-ed. Scattered as we were by covid, none of us at the  Times  could speak face to face, and nobody was thinking very clearly. That seems understandable, given the frantic pile-up of circumstances. It would be reasonable now for all of us \u2013 me, Sulzberger, the journalists who were declaring their fright on Twitter \u2013 to look back, shake our heads and say that was a crazy time, and we all made some mistakes.\nBut the  Times  is not good at acknowledging mistakes. Indeed, one of my own, within the  Times  culture, was to take responsibility for any mistakes my department made, and even some it didn\u2019t. To Sulzberger, the meltdown over Cotton\u2019s op-ed and my departure in disgrace are explained and justified by a failure of editorial \u201cprocess\u201d. As he put it in an interview with the  New Yorker  this summer, after publishing his piece in the  Columbia Journalism Review  , Cotton\u2019s piece was not \u201cperfectly fact-checked\u201d and the editors had not \u201cthought about the headline and presentation\u201d. He contrasted the execution of Cotton\u2019s opinion piece with that of a months-long investigation the newsroom did of Donald Trump\u2019s taxes (which was not \u201cperfectly fact-checked\u201d, as it happens \u2013 it required a correction). He did not explain why, if the  Times  was an independent publication, an op-ed making a mainstream conservative argument should have to meet such different standards from an op-ed making any other kind of argument, such as for the abolition of the police. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough just to have the principle and wave it around,\u201d he said. \u201cYou also have to execute on it.\u201d\nTo me, extolling the virtue of independent journalism in the pages of the  Columbia Journalism Review  is how you wave a principle around. Publishing a piece like Cotton\u2019s is how you execute on it. As Sulzberger also wrote in the  Review  , \u201cIndependent journalism, especially in a pluralistic democracy, should err on the side of treating areas of serious political contest as open, unsettled, and in need of further inquiry.\u201d It matters that conflicting views do not just appear before different audiences in politically rivalrous publications or cable news networks, but instead in the same forum, before the same readers, subject to the same standards for fact and argumentation. That is also, by the way, an important means by which politicians, like Cotton, can learn, by speaking to audiences who are not inclined to nod along with them. That was our ambition for  Times  Opinion \u2013 or mine, I guess. Americans can shout about their lack of free speech all they want, but they will never be able to overcome their differences, and deal with any of their real problems, if they do not learn to listen to each other again.\nIf Sulzberger must insist on comparing the execution of the Cotton op-ed with that of the most ambitious of newsroom projects, let him compare it with something really important, the 1619 Project, which commemorated the 400th anniversary of the arrival of enslaved Africans in Virginia. Like Cotton\u2019s piece, the 1619 Project was fact-checked and copy-edited (most of the  Times  newsroom does not fact-check or copy-edit articles, but the magazine does). But it nevertheless contained mistakes, as journalism often does. Some of these mistakes ignited a firestorm among historians and other readers.\nAnd, like Cotton\u2019s piece, the 1619 Project was presented in a way the  Times  later judged to be too provocative. The  Times  declared that the 1619 Project \u201caims to reframe the country\u2019s history, understanding 1619 as our true founding\u201d. That bold statement \u2013 a declaration of  Times  fact, not opinion, since it came from the newsroom \u2013 outraged many Americans who venerated 1776 as the founding. The  Times  later stealthily erased it from the digital version of the project, but was caught doing so by a writer for the publication  Quillette  . Sulzberger told me during the initial uproar that the top editors in the newsroom \u2013 not just Baquet but his deputy \u2013 had not reviewed the audacious statement of purpose, one of the biggest editorial claims the paper has ever made. They also, of course, did not edit all the pieces themselves, trusting the magazine\u2019s editors to do that work.\nIf the 1619 Project and the Cotton op-ed shared the same supposed flaws and excited similar outrage, how come that one is lauded as a landmark success and the other is a sackable offence? In asking this, I am not running down the 1619 Project. It was excellent, above all because it made arguments readers should hear and consider. And to be clear: unlike Sulzberger, I do not see any equivalence between any huge project like that and a single op-ed piece. The parallel is absurd. I am comparing them only to meet Sulzberger on his terms, in order to illuminate what he is trying to elide. What distinguished the Cotton piece was not an error, or strong language, or that I didn\u2019t edit it personally. What distinguished that op-ed was not process. It was politics. It is one thing for the  Times  to aggravate historians, or conservatives, or even old-school liberals who believe in open debate. It has become quite another for the  Times  to challenge some members of its own staff with ideas that might contradict their view of the world.\nThe lessons of the incident are not about how to write a headline but about how much the  Times  has changed \u2013 how digital technology, the paper\u2019s new business model and the rise of new ideals among its staff have altered its understanding of the boundary between news and opinion, and of the relationship between truth and justice. Ejecting me was one way to avoid confronting the question of which values the  Times  is committed to. Waving around the word \u201cprocess\u201d is another.\nWhat still seems most striking about the Cotton episode is how out of sync the leaders of the paper were with the ascendant, illiberal values within it. Cotton\u2019s essay brought into focus conflicts over the role of journalism that had been growing within the  Times  for years, and that the leadership has largely ducked away from. Is it journalism\u2019s role to salt wounds or to salve them, to promote debates or settle them, to ask or to answer? Is its proper posture humble or righteous? As journalists trained in what was once the conventional way, with the old set of principles, Sulzberger, Baquet and I reacted similarly to Cotton\u2019s essay: here\u2019s a potentially consequential idea from an influential voice. It may make readers uncomfortable, and they should know about it and evaluate it partly for that very reason.\nTimes  colleagues who were frightened or angry about the piece had the opposite view: that readers should not hear Cotton\u2019s argument. To expose them to it was to risk that they might be persuaded by an elected politician.\nAs he asserts the independence of  Times  Times  New Yorker\nTimes\nTimes  Times\nTimes  Times\nTimes  Times  Washington Post  Times  Times  Times\nJames Bennet  is",
                            "html": "<p><span> A </span> re we truly so precious?\u201d Dean Baquet, the executive editor of the <i> New York Times </i> , asked me one Wednesday evening in June 2020. I was the editorial-page editor of the <i> Times </i> , and we had just published an op-ed by <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/united-states/2016/10/15/growing-cotton-in-iowa\"> Tom Cotton </a> , a senator from Arkansas, that was outraging many members of the <i> Times </i> staff. America\u2019s conscience had been shocked days before by images of a white police officer kneeling on the neck of a black man, George Floyd, until he died. It was a frenzied time in America, assaulted by covid-19, scalded by police barbarism. Throughout the country <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/06/01/history-is-repeated-in-protests-at-the-death-of-george-floyd\"> protesters were on the march </a> . Substantive reform of the police, so long delayed, suddenly seemed like a real possibility, but so did violence and political backlash. In some cities rioting and looting had broken out. </p><p> It was the kind of crisis in which journalism could fulfil its highest ambitions of helping readers understand the world, in order to fix it, and in the <i> Times </i> \u2019s Opinion section, which I oversaw, we were pursuing our role of presenting <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2020/07/16/how-objectivity-in-journalism-became-a-matter-of-opinion\"> debate from all sides </a> . We had published pieces arguing against the idea of relying on troops to stop the violence, and one urging abolition of the police altogether. But Cotton, an army veteran, was calling for the use of troops to protect lives and businesses from rioters. Some <i> Times </i> reporters and other staff were taking to what was then called Twitter, now called X, to attack the decision to publish his argument, for fear he would persuade <i> Times </i> readers to support his proposal and it would be enacted. The next day the <i> Times </i> \u2019s union\u2014its unit of the NewsGuild- <small> CWA </small> \u2014would issue a statement calling the op-ed \u201ca clear threat to the health and safety of the journalists we represent\u201d. </p><p> The <i> Times </i> had endured many cycles of Twitter outrage for one story or opinion piece or another. It was never fun; it felt like sticking your head in a metal bucket while people were banging it with hammers. The publisher, A.G. Sulzberger, who was about two years into the job, understood why we\u2019d published the op-ed. He had some criticisms about packaging; he said the editors should add links to other op-eds we\u2019d published with a different view. But he\u2019d emailed me that afternoon, saying: \u201cI get and support the reason for including the piece,\u201d because, he thought, Cotton\u2019s view had the support of the White House as well as a majority of the Senate. As the clamour grew, he asked me to call Baquet, the paper\u2019s most senior editor. </p><p> Like me, Baquet seemed taken aback by the criticism that <i> Times </i> readers shouldn\u2019t hear what Cotton had to say. Cotton had a lot of influence with the White House, Baquet noted, and he could well be making his argument directly to the president, Donald Trump. Readers should know about it. Cotton was also a possible future contender for the White House himself, Baquet added. And, besides, Cotton was far from alone: lots of Americans agreed with him\u2014most of them, according to some polls. \u201cAre we truly so precious?\u201d Baquet asked again, with a note of wonder and frustration. </p><p> The answer, it turned out, was yes. Less than three days later, on Saturday morning, Sulzberger called me at home and, with an icy anger that still puzzles and saddens me, demanded my resignation. I got mad, too, and said he\u2019d have to fire me. I thought better of that later. I called him back and agreed to resign, flattering myself that I was being noble. </p><p> Whether or not American democracy endures, a central question historians are sure to ask about this era is why America came to elect Donald Trump, promoting him from a symptom of the country\u2019s institutional, political and social degradation to its agent-in-chief. There are many reasons for Trump\u2019s ascent, but changes in the American news media played a critical role. Trump\u2019s manipulation and every one of his political lies became more powerful because journalists had forfeited what had always been most valuable about their work: their credibility as arbiters of truth and brokers of ideas, which for more than a century, despite all of journalism\u2019s flaws and failures, had been a bulwark of how Americans govern themselves. </p><p> I hope those historians will also be able to tell the story of how journalism found its footing again \u2013 how editors, reporters and readers, too, came to recognise that journalism needed to change to fulfil its potential in restoring the health of American politics. As Trump\u2019s nomination and possible re-election loom, that work could not be more urgent. </p><p> I think Sulzberger shares this analysis. In interviews and his own writings, including an essay earlier this year for the <i> Columbia Journalism Review </i> , he has defended \u201cindependent journalism\u201d, or, as I understand him, fair-minded, truth-seeking journalism that aspires to be open and objective. It\u2019s good to hear the publisher speak up in defence of such values, some of which have fallen out of fashion not just with journalists at the <i> Times </i> and other mainstream publications but at some of the most prestigious schools of journalism. Until that miserable Saturday morning I thought I was standing shoulder-to-shoulder with him in a struggle to revive them. I thought, and still think, that no American institution could have a better chance than the <i> Times </i> , by virtue of its principles, its history, its people and its hold on the attention of influential Americans, to lead the resistance to the corruption of political and intellectual life, to overcome the encroaching dogmatism and intolerance. </p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.design-system.economist.com/assets/latest/common/static/images/image/image-placeholder.svg\"><figcaption class=\"css-18w36g1 edweubf2\"><span> Tom Cotton speaking at the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in 2020 </span></figcaption></figure><p> But Sulzberger seems to underestimate the struggle he is in, that all journalism and indeed America itself is in. In describing the essential qualities of independent journalism in his essay, he unspooled a list of admirable traits \u2013 empathy, humility, curiosity and so forth. These qualities have for generations been helpful in contending with the <i> Times </i> \u2019s familiar problem, which is liberal bias. I have no doubt Sulzberger believes in them. Years ago he demonstrated them himself as a reporter, covering the American Midwest as a real place full of three-dimensional people, and it would be nice if they were enough to deal with the challenge of this era, too. But, on their own, these qualities have no chance against the <i> Times </i> \u2019s new, more dangerous problem, which is in crucial respects the opposite of the old one. </p><p> The <i> Times </i> \u2019s problem has metastasised from liberal bias to illiberal bias, from an inclination to favour one side of the national debate to an impulse to shut debate down altogether. All the empathy and humility in the world will not mean much against the pressures of intolerance and tribalism without an invaluable quality that Sulzberger did not emphasise: courage. </p><p> Don\u2019t get me wrong. Most journalism obviously doesn\u2019t require anything like the bravery expected of a soldier, police officer or protester. But far more than when I set out to become a journalist, doing the work right today demands a particular kind of courage: not just the devil-may-care courage to choose a profession on the brink of the abyss; not just the bulldog courage to endlessly pick yourself up and embrace the ever-evolving technology; but also, in an era when polarisation and social media viciously enforce rigid orthodoxies, the moral and intellectual courage to take the other side seriously and to report truths and ideas that your own side demonises for fear they will harm its cause. </p><p> One of the glories of embracing illiberalism is that, like Trump, you are always right about everything, and so you are justified in shouting disagreement down. In the face of this, leaders of many workplaces and boardrooms across America find that it is so much easier to compromise than to confront \u2013 to give a little ground today in the belief you can ultimately bring people around. This is how reasonable Republican leaders lost control of their party to Trump and how liberal-minded college presidents lost control of their campuses. And it is why the leadership of the <i> New York Times </i> is losing control of its principles. </p><p> Over the decades the <i> Times </i> and other mainstream news organisations failed plenty of times to live up to their commitments to integrity and open-mindedness. The relentless struggle against biases and preconceptions, rather than the achievement of a superhuman objective omniscience, is what mattered. As everyone knows, the internet knocked the industry off its foundations. Local newspapers were the proving ground between college campuses and national newsrooms. As they disintegrated, the national news media lost a source of seasoned reporters and many Americans lost a journalism whose truth they could verify with their own eyes. As the country became more polarised, the national media followed the money by serving partisan audiences the versions of reality they preferred. This relationship proved self-reinforcing. As Americans became freer to choose among alternative versions of reality, their polarisation intensified. When I was at the <i> Times </i> , the newsroom editors worked hardest to keep Washington coverage open and unbiased, no easy task in the Trump era. And there are still people, in the Washington bureau and across the <i> Times </i> , doing work as fine as can be found in American journalism. But as the top editors let bias creep into certain areas of coverage, such as culture, lifestyle and business, that made the core harder to defend and undermined the authority of even the best reporters. </p><p> There have been signs the <i> Times </i> is trying to recover the courage of its convictions. The paper was slow to display much curiosity about the hard question of the proper medical protocols for trans children; but once it did, the editors defended their coverage against the inevitable criticism. For any counter-revolution to succeed, the leadership will need to show courage worthy of the paper\u2019s bravest reporters and opinion columnists, the ones who work in war zones or explore ideas that make illiberal staff members shudder. As Sulzberger told me in the past, returning to the old standards will require agonising change. He saw that as the gradual work of many years, but I think he is mistaken. To overcome the cultural and commercial pressures the <i> Times </i> faces, particularly given the severe test posed by another Trump candidacy and possible presidency, its publisher and senior editors will have to be bolder than that. </p><p> Since Adolph Ochs bought the paper in 1896, one of the most inspiring things the <i> Times </i> has said about itself is that it does its work \u201cwithout fear or favour\u201d. That is not true of the institution today \u2013 it cannot be, not when its journalists are afraid to trust readers with a mainstream conservative argument such as Cotton\u2019s, and its leaders are afraid to say otherwise. As preoccupied as it is with the question of why so many Americans have lost trust in it, the <i> Times </i> is failing to face up to one crucial reason: that it has lost faith in Americans, too. </p><p> For now, to assert that the <i> Times </i> plays by the same rules it always has is to commit a hypocrisy that is transparent to conservatives, dangerous to liberals and bad for the country as a whole. It makes the <i> Times </i> too easy for conservatives to dismiss and too easy for progressives to believe. The reality is that the <i> Times </i> is becoming the publication through which America\u2019s progressive elite talks to itself about an America that does not really exist. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20231213_1843_NYT_02.jpg\"><figcaption class=\"css-18w36g1 edweubf2\"><span> James Bennet ( <i> second left </i> ) with Hillary Clinton ( <i> far right </i> ) on her trip as First Lady to north Africa in 1999 </span></figcaption></figure><p> It is hard to imagine a path back to saner American politics that does not traverse a common ground of shared fact. It is equally hard to imagine how America\u2019s diversity can continue to be a source of strength, rather than become a fatal flaw, if Americans are afraid or unwilling to listen to each other. I suppose it is also pretty grandiose to think you might help fix all that. But that hope, to me, is what makes journalism worth doing. </p><p><span> T </span> he <i> New York Tim </i> es taught me how to do daily journalism. I joined the paper, for my first stint, in the pre-internet days, in an era of American journalism so different that it was almost another profession. Back in 1991 the <i> Times </i> was anxious not about a print business that was collapsing but about an industry so robust that Long Island <i> Newsday </i> was making a push into New York City. A newspaper war was under way, and the <i> Times </i> was fighting back by expanding its Metro desk, hiring reporters and opening bureaus in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. </p><p> Metro was the biggest news desk. New reporters had to do rotations of up to a year there to learn the culture and folkways of the paper. Baquet, surely among the greatest investigative journalists America has produced, was then in Metro. I was brought on as a probationary reporter, with a year to prove myself, and like other new hires was put through a series of assignments at the low end of the hierarchy. </p><p> After about six months the Metro editor, Gerald Boyd, asked me to take a walk with him, as it turned out, to deliver a harsh lesson in <i> Times </i> ian ambition and discipline. Chain-smoking, speaking in his whispery, peculiarly high-pitched voice, he kicked my ass from one end of Times Square to the other. He had taken a chance hiring me, and he was disappointed. There was nothing special about my stories. At the rate I was going, I had no chance of making it onto the paper. </p><p> The next day was a Saturday, and I reached Boyd at home through the Metro desk to rattle off the speech I\u2019d endlessly rehearsed while staring at the ceiling all night. The gist was that the desk had kept me chasing small-bore stories, blah blah blah. Boyd sounded less surprised than amused to hear from me, and soon gave me a new assignment, asking me to spend three months covering the elderly, one of several new \u201cmini-beats\u201d on subjects the desk had overlooked. </p><p> I was worried there were good reasons this particular beat had been ignored. At 26, as one of the youngest reporters on the desk, I was also not an obvious candidate for the role of house expert on the wise and grey. But Boyd assigned me to an excellent editor, Suzanne Daley, and as I began studying the city\u2019s elderly and interviewing experts and actual old people, I began to discover the rewards granted any serious reporter: that when you acknowledge how little you know, looking in at a world from the outside brings a special clarity. </p><p> The subject was more complicated and richer than I imagined, and every person had stories to tell. I wrote about hunger, <small> AIDS </small> and romance among the elderly, about old comedians telling old jokes to old people in senior centres. As I reported on Jews who had fled Germany to settle in Washington Heights or black Americans who had left the Jim Crow south to settle in Bushwick, Brooklyn, it dawned on me that, thanks to Boyd, I was covering the history of the world in the 20th century through the eyes of those who had lived it. </p><p> After joining the permanent staff, I went, again in humbling ignorance, to Detroit, to cover the auto companies\u2019 \u2013 and the city\u2019s \u2013 struggle to recapture their former glory. And again I had a chance to learn, in this case, everything from how the largest companies in the world were run, to what it was like to work the line or the sales floor, to the struggle and dignity of life in one of America\u2019s most captivating cities. \u201cWe still have a long way to go,\u201d Rosa Parks told me, when I interviewed her after she had been robbed and beaten in her home on Detroit\u2019s west side one August night in 1994. \u201cAnd so many of our children are going astray.\u201d </p><p> I began to write about presidential politics two years later, in 1996, and as the most inexperienced member of the team was assigned to cover a long-shot Republican candidate, Pat Buchanan. I packed a bag for a four-day reporting trip and did not return home for six weeks. Buchanan campaigned on an eccentric fusion of social conservatism and statist economic policies, along with coded appeals to racism and antisemitism, that 30 years earlier had elevated George Wallace and 20 years later would be rebranded as Trumpism. He also campaigned with conviction, humour and even joy, a combination I have rarely witnessed. As a Democrat from a family of Democrats, a graduate of Yale and a blossom of the imagined meritocracy, I had my first real chance, at Buchanan\u2019s rallies, to see the world through the eyes of stalwart opponents of abortion, immigration and the relentlessly rising tide of modernity. </p><p> The task of making the world intelligible was even greater in my first foreign assignment. I arrived in Jerusalem a week before the attacks of September 11th 2001, just after the second intifada had broken out. I had been to the Middle East just once, as a White House reporter covering President Bill Clinton. \u201cWell, in at the deep end,\u201d the foreign editor, Roger Cohen, told me before I left. To spend time with the perpetrators and victims of violence in the Middle East, to listen hard to the reciprocal and reinforcing stories of new and ancient grievances, is to confront the tragic truth that there can be justice on more than one side of a conflict. More than ever, it seemed to me that a reporter gave up something in renouncing the taking of sides: possibly the moral high ground, certainly the psychological satisfaction of righteous anger. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20231213_1843_NYT_03.jpg\"><figcaption class=\"css-18w36g1 edweubf2\"><span> Pat Buchanan during the New Hampshire primary </span></figcaption></figure><p> But there was a compensating moral and psychological privilege that came with aspiring to journalistic neutrality and open-mindedness, despised as they might understandably be by partisans. Unlike the duelling politicians and advocates of all kinds, unlike the corporate chieftains and their critics, unlike even the sainted non-profit workers, you did not have to pretend things were simpler than they actually were. You did not have to go along with everything that any tribe said. You did not have to pretend that the good guys, much as you might have respected them, were right about everything, or that the bad guys, much as you might have disdained them, never had a point. You did not, in other words, ever have to lie. </p><p> This fundamental honesty was vital for readers, because it equipped them to make better, more informed judgments about the world. Sometimes it might shock or upset them by failing to conform to their picture of reality. But it also granted them the respect of acknowledging that they were able to work things out for themselves. </p><p> What a gift it was to be taught and trusted as I was by my editors \u2013 to be a reporter with licence to ask anyone anything, to experience the whole world as a school and every source and subject as a teacher. I left after 15 years, in 2006, when I had the chance to become editor of the <i> Atlantic </i> . Rather than starting out on yet another beat at the <i> Times </i> , I felt ready to put my experience to work and ambitious for the responsibility to shape coverage myself. It was also obvious how much the internet was changing journalism. I was eager to figure out how to use it, and anxious about being at the mercy of choices by others, in a time not just of existential peril for the industry, but maybe of opportunity. </p><p> The <i> Atlantic </i> did not aspire to the same role as the <i> Times </i> . It did not promise to serve up the news of the day without any bias. But it was to opinion journalism what the <i> Times </i> \u2019s reporting was supposed to be to news: honest and open to the world. The question was what the magazine\u2019s 19th-century claim of intellectual independence \u2013 to be \u201cof no party or clique\u201d \u2013 should mean in the digital era. </p><p> Those were the glory days of the blog, and we hit on the idea of creating a living op-ed page, a collective of bloggers with different points of view but a shared intellectual honesty who would argue out the meaning of the news of the day. They were brilliant, gutsy writers, and their disagreements were deep enough that I used to joke that my main work as editor was to prevent fistfights. </p><p> The lessons we learned from adapting the <i> Atlantic </i> to the internet washed back into print. Under its owner, David Bradley, my colleagues and I distilled our purpose as publishing big arguments about big ideas. We made some mistakes \u2013 that goes along with any serious journalism ambitious to make a change, and to embrace change itself \u2013 but we also began producing some of the most important work in American journalism: Nicholas Carr on whether Google was \u201cmaking us stupid\u201d; Hanna Rosin on \u201cthe end of men\u201d; Taylor Branch on \u201cthe shame of college sports\u201d; Ta-Nehisi Coates on \u201cthe case for reparations\u201d; Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt on \u201cthe coddling of the American mind\u201d. </p><p> I was starting to see some effects of the new campus politics within the <i> Atlantic </i> . A promising new editor had created a digital form for aspiring freelancers to fill out, and she wanted to ask them to disclose their racial and sexual identity. Why? Because, she said, if we were to write about the trans community, for example, we would ask a trans person to write the story. There was a good argument for that, I acknowledged, and it sometimes might be the right answer. But as I thought about the old people, auto workers and abortion opponents I had learned from, I told her there was also an argument for correspondents who brought an outsider\u2019s ignorance, along with curiosity and empathy, to the story. </p><p> A journalism that starts out assuming it knows the answers, it seemed to me then, and seems even more so to me now, can be far less valuable to the reader than a journalism that starts out with a humbling awareness that it knows nothing. \u201cIn truly effective thinking\u201d, Walter Lippmann wrote 100 years ago in \u201cPublic Opinion\u201d, \u201cthe prime necessity is to liquidate judgments, regain an innocent eye, disentangle feelings, be curious and open-hearted.\u201d Alarmed by the shoddy journalism of his day, Lippmann was calling for journalists to struggle against their ignorance and assumptions in order to help Americans resist the increasingly sophisticated tools of propagandists. As the <i> Atlantic </i> made its digital transition, one thing I preached was that we could not cling to any tradition or convention, however hallowed, for its own sake, but only if it was relevant to the needs of readers today. In the age of the internet it is hard even for a child to sustain an \u201cinnocent eye\u201d, but the alternative for journalists remains as dangerous as ever, to become propagandists. America has more than enough of those already. </p><p> What we did together at the <i> Atlantic </i> worked. We dramatically increased the magazine\u2019s audience and influence while making it profitable for the first time in generations. After I had spent ten years as editor, the last few as co-president, the publisher, A.G. Sulzberger\u2019s father, also an Arthur Sulzberger, asked me to return to the <i> Times </i> as editorial-page editor. </p><p> His offer, I thought, would give me the chance to do the kind of journalism I loved with more resources and greater effect. The freedom Opinion had to experiment with voice and point of view meant that it would be more able than the <i> Times </i> newsroom to take advantage of the tools of digital journalism, from audio to video to graphics. Opinion writers could also break out of limiting print conventions and do more in-depth, reported columns and editorials. Though the Opinion department, which then had about 100 staff, was a fraction the size of the newsroom, with more than 1,300, Opinion\u2019s work had outsized reach. Most important, the <i> Times </i> , probably more than any other American institution, could influence the way society approached debate and engagement with opposing views. If <i> Times </i> Opinion demonstrated the same kind of intellectual courage and curiosity that my colleagues at the <i> Atlantic </i> had shown, I hoped, the rest of the media would follow. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20231213_1843_NYT_04.jpg\"><figcaption class=\"css-18w36g1 edweubf2\"><span> A.G. Sulzberger, publisher of the <i> New York Times </i></span></figcaption></figure><p> No doubt Sulzberger\u2019s offer also appealed not just to my loyalty to the <i> Times </i> , but to my ambition as well. I would report directly to the publisher, and I was immediately seen, inside and outside the paper, as a candidate for the top job. I had hoped being in Opinion would exempt me from the infamous political games of the newsroom, but it did not, and no doubt my old colleagues felt I was playing such games myself. Fairly quickly, though, I realised two things: first, that if I did my job as I thought it should be done, and as the Sulzbergers said they wanted me to do it, I would be too polarising internally ever to lead the newsroom; second, that I did not want that job, though no one but my wife believed me when I said that. </p><p> It was 2016, a presidential-election year, and I had been gone from the <i> Times </i> for a decade. Although many of my old colleagues had also left in the interim and the <i> Times </i> had moved into a new glass-and-steel tower, I otherwise had little idea how much things had changed. When I looked around the Opinion department, change was not what I perceived. Excellent writers and editors were doing excellent work. But the department\u2019s journalism was consumed with politics and foreign affairs in an era when readers were also fascinated by changes in technology, business, science and culture. </p><p> The Opinion department mocked the paper\u2019s claim to value diversity. It did not have a single black editor. The large staff of op-ed editors contained only a couple of women. Although the 11 columnists were individually admirable, only two of them were women and only one was a person of colour. (The <i> Times </i> had not appointed a black columnist until the 1990s, and had only employed two in total.) Not only did they all focus on politics and foreign affairs, but during the 2016 campaign, no columnist shared, in broad terms, the worldview of the ascendant progressives of the Democratic Party, incarnated by Bernie Sanders. And only two were conservative. </p><p> This last fact was of particular concern to the elder Sulzberger. He told me the <i> Times </i> needed more conservative voices, and that its own editorial line had become predictably left-wing. \u201cToo many liberals,\u201d read my notes about the Opinion line-up from a meeting I had with him and Mark Thompson, then the chief executive, as I was preparing to rejoin the paper. \u201cEven conservatives are liberals\u2019 idea of a conservative.\u201d The last note I took from that meeting was: \u201cCan\u2019t ignore 150m conservative Americans.\u201d </p><p> With my Opinion colleagues, I set out to deal with this long list of needs. I restructured the department, changing everybody\u2019s role and, using buyouts, changing people as well. It was too much, too fast; it rocked the department, and my colleagues and I made mistakes amid the turmoil, including one that brought a libel suit from John McCain\u2019s vice-presidential running-mate, Sarah Palin, dismissed twice by a judge and once by a jury but endlessly appealed on procedural grounds. Yet we also did more in four years to diversify the line-up of writers by identity, ideology and expertise than the <i> Times </i> had in the previous century; we published more ambitious projects than Opinion had ever attempted. We won two Pulitzer prizes in four years \u2013 as many as the department had in the previous 20. </p><p> As I knew from my time at the <i> Atlantic, </i> this kind of structural transformation can be frightening and even infuriating for those understandably proud of things as they are. It is hard on everyone. But experience at the <i> Atlantic </i> also taught me that pursuing new ways of doing journalism in pursuit of venerable institutional principles created enthusiasm for change. I expected that same dynamic to allay concerns at the <i> Times </i> . </p><p> In that same statement in 1896, after committing the <i> Times </i> to pursue the news without fear or favour, Ochs promised to \u201cinvite intelligent discussion from all shades of opinion\u201d. So adding new voices, some more progressive and others more conservative, and more journalists of diverse identities and backgrounds, fulfilled the paper\u2019s historic purpose. If Opinion published a wider range of views, it would help frame a set of shared arguments that corresponded to, and drew upon, the set of shared facts coming from the newsroom. On the right and left, America\u2019s elites now talk within their tribes, and get angry or contemptuous on those occasions when they happen to overhear the other conclave. If they could be coaxed to agree what they were arguing about, and the rules by which they would argue about it, opinion journalism could serve a foundational need of the democracy by fostering diverse and inclusive debate. Who could be against that? </p><p> Out of naivety or arrogance, I was slow to recognise that at the <i> Times </i> , unlike at the <i> Atlantic </i> , these values were no longer universally accepted, let alone esteemed. When I first took the job, I felt some days as if I\u2019d parachuted onto one of those Pacific islands still held by Japanese soldiers who didn\u2019t know that the world beyond the waves had changed. Eventually, it sank in that my snotty joke was actually on me: I was the one ignorantly fighting a battle that was already lost. The old liberal embrace of inclusive debate that reflected the country\u2019s breadth of views had given way to a new intolerance for the opinions of roughly half of American voters. New progressive voices were celebrated within the <i> Times </i> . But in contrast to the <i> Wall Street Journal </i> and the <i> Washington Post, </i> conservative voices \u2013 even eloquent anti-Trump conservative voices \u2013 were despised, regardless of how many leftists might surround them. (President Trump himself submitted one op-ed during my time, but we could not raise it to our standards \u2013 his people would not agree to the edits we asked for.) </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20231213_1843_NYT_05.jpg\"></figure><p> About a year after the 2016 election, the <i> Times </i> newsroom published a profile of a man from Ohio who had attended the rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, at which a white nationalist drove his car into a crowd of protesters, killing one. It was a terrifying piece. The man had four cats, listened to National Public Radio, and had registered at Target for a muffin pan before his recent wedding. In exploring his evolution from \u201cvaguely leftist rock musician to ardent libertarian to fascist activist\u201d the article rang an alarm about how \u201cthe election of President Donald Trump helped open a space for people like him\u201d. </p><p> The profile was in keeping with the <i> Times </i> \u2019s tradition of confronting readers with the confounding reality of the world around them. After the 9/11 attacks, as the bureau chief in Jerusalem, I spent a lot of time in the Gaza Strip interviewing Hamas leaders, recruiters and foot soldiers, trying to understand and describe their murderous ideology. Some readers complained that I was providing a platform for terrorists, but there was never any objection from within the <i> Times </i> . (Nor did it occur to me to complain that by publishing op-eds critical of Hamas the Opinion department was putting my life in danger.) Our role, we knew, was to help readers understand such threats, and this required empathetic \u2013 not sympathetic \u2013 reporting. This is not an easy distinction but good reporters make it: they learn to understand and communicate the sources and nature of a toxic ideology without justifying it, much less advocating it. </p><p> Today\u2019s newsroom turns that moral logic on its head, at least when it comes to fellow Americans. Unlike the views of Hamas, the views of many Americans have come to seem dangerous to engage in the absence of explicit condemnation. Focusing on potential perpetrators \u2013 \u201cplatforming\u201d them by explaining rather than judging their views \u2013 is believed to empower them to do more harm. After the profile of the Ohio man was published, media Twitter lit up with attacks on the article as \u201cnormalising\u201d Nazism and white nationalism, and the <i> Times </i> convulsed internally. The <i> Times </i> wound up publishing a cringing editor\u2019s note that hung the writer out to dry and approvingly quoted some of the criticism, including a tweet from a <i> Washington Post </i> opinion editor asking, \u201cInstead of long, glowing profiles of Nazis/White nationalists, why don\u2019t we profile the victims of their ideologies\u201d? The <i> Times </i> did profile the victims of such ideologies; and the very headline of the piece \u2013 \u201cA Voice of Hate in America\u2019s Heartland\u201d \u2013 undermined the claim that it was \u201cglowing\u201d. But the <i> Times </i> lacked the confidence to defend its own work. (As it happens, being platformed did not do much to increase the power of that Ohio man. He, his wife and his brother lost their jobs and the newly married couple lost the home intended for their muffin pan.) </p><p> The editor\u2019s note paraded the principle of publishing such pieces, saying it was important to \u201cshed more light, not less, on the most extreme corners of American life\u201d. But less light is what the readers got. As a reporter in the newsroom, you\u2019d have to have been an idiot after that explosion to attempt such a profile. Empathetic reporting about Trump supporters became even more rare. It became a clich\u00e9 among influential left-wing columnists and editors that blinkered political reporters interviewed a few Trump supporters in diners and came away suckered into thinking there was something besides racism that could explain anyone\u2019s support for the man. </p><p> I failed to take the hint. As the first anniversary of Trump\u2019s inauguration approached, the editors who compile letters to the <i> Times </i> , part of my department, had put out a request to readers who supported the president to say what they thought of him now. The results had some nuance. \u201cYes, he is embarrassing,\u201d wrote one reader. \u201cYes, he picks unnecessary fights. But he also pushed tax reform through, has largely defeated <small> ISIS </small> in Iraq,\u201d and so forth. After a year spent publishing editorials attacking Trump and his policies, I thought it would be a demonstration of <i> Times </i> ian open-mindedness to give his supporters their say. Also, I thought the letters were interesting, so I turned over the entire editorial page to the Trump letters. </p><p> I wasn\u2019t surprised that we got some criticism on Twitter. But I was astonished by the fury of my <i> Times </i> colleagues. I found myself facing an angry internal town hall, trying to justify what to me was an obvious journalistic decision. During the session, one of the newsroom\u2019s journalists demanded to know when I would publish a page of letters from Barack Obama\u2019s supporters. I stammered out some kind of answer. The question just didn\u2019t make sense to me. Pretty much every day we published letters from people who supported Obama and criticised Trump. Didn\u2019t he know that Obama wasn\u2019t president any more? Didn\u2019t he think other <i> Times </i> readers should understand the sources of Trump\u2019s support? Didn\u2019t he also see it was a wonderful thing that some Trump supporters did not just dismiss the <i> Times </i> as fake news, but still believed in it enough to respond thoughtfully to an invitation to share their views? </p><p> And if the <i> Times </i> could not bear to publish the views of Americans who supported Trump, why should it be surprised that those voters would not trust it? Two years later, in 2020, Baquet acknowledged that in 2016 the <i> Times </i> had failed to take seriously the idea that Trump could become president partly because it failed to send its reporters out into America to listen to voters and understand \u201cthe turmoil in the country\u201d. And, he continued, the <i> Times </i> still did not understand the views of many Americans. \u201cOne of the great puzzles of 2016 remains a great puzzle,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy did millions and millions of Americans vote for a guy who\u2019s such an unusual candidate?\u201d Speaking four months before we published the Cotton op-ed, he said that to argue that the views of such voters should not appear in the <i> Times </i> was \u201cnot journalistic\u201d. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20231213_1843_NYT_06.jpg\"></figure><p> Conservative arguments in the Opinion pages reliably started uproars within the <i> Times </i> . Sometimes I would hear directly from colleagues who had the grace to confront me with their concerns; more often they would take to the company\u2019s Slack channels or Twitter to advertise their distress in front of each other. By contrast, in my four years as Opinion editor, I received just two complaints from newsroom staff about pieces we published from the left. When I was visiting one of the <i> Times </i> \u2019s West Coast bureaus, a reporter pulled me aside to say he worried that a liberal columnist was engaged in ad hominem attacks; a reporter in the Washington bureau wrote to me to object to an op-ed piece questioning the value of protecting free speech for right-wing groups. </p><p> This environment of enforced group-think, inside and outside the paper, was hard even on liberal opinion writers. One left-of-centre columnist told me that he was reluctant to appear in the New York office for fear of being accosted by colleagues. (An internal survey shortly after I left the paper found that barely half the staff, within an enterprise ostensibly devoted to telling the truth, agreed \u201cthere is a free exchange of views in this company\u201d and \u201cpeople are not afraid to say what they really think\u201d.) Even columnists with impeccable leftist bona fides recoiled from tackling subjects when their point of view might depart from progressive orthodoxy. I once complimented a long-time, left-leaning Opinion writer over a column criticising Democrats in Congress for doing something stupid. Trying to encourage more such journalism and thus less such stupidity, I remarked that this kind of argument had more influence than yet another Trump-is-a-devil column. \u201cI know,\u201d he replied, ruefully. \u201cBut Twitter hates it.\u201d </p><p> The bias had become so pervasive, even in the senior editing ranks of the newsroom, as to be unconscious. Trying to be helpful, one of the top newsroom editors urged me to start attaching trigger warnings to pieces by conservatives. It had not occurred to him how this would stigmatise certain colleagues, or what it would say to the world about the <i> Times </i> \u2019s own bias. By their nature, information bubbles are powerfully self-reinforcing, and I think many <i> Times </i> staff have little idea how closed their world has become, or how far they are from fulfilling their compact with readers to show the world \u201cwithout fear or favour\u201d. And sometimes the bias was explicit: one newsroom editor told me that, because I was publishing more conservatives, he felt he needed to push his own department further to the left. </p><p> The <i> Times </i> \u2019s failure to honour its own stated principles of openness to a range of views was particularly hard on the handful of conservative writers, some of whom would complain about being flyspecked and abused by colleagues. One day when I relayed a conservative\u2019s concern about double standards to Sulzberger, he lost his patience. He told me to inform the complaining conservative that that\u2019s just how it was: there was a double standard and he should get used to it. A publication that promises its readers to stand apart from politics should not have different standards for different writers based on their politics. But I delivered the message. There are many things I regret about my tenure as editorial-page editor. That is the only act of which I am ashamed. </p><p><span> A </span> s I realised how different the new <i> Times </i> had become from the old one that trained me, I began to think of myself not as a benighted veteran on a remote island, but as Rip Van Winkle. I had left one newspaper, had a pleasant dream for ten years, and returned to a place I barely recognised. The new <i> New York Times </i> was the product of two shocks \u2013 sudden collapse, and then sudden success. The paper almost went bankrupt during the financial crisis, and the ensuing panic provoked a crisis of confidence among its leaders. Digital competitors like the <i> HuffPost </i> were gaining readers and winning plaudits within the media industry as innovative. They were the cool kids; <i> Times </i> folk were ink-stained wrinklies. </p><p> In its panic, the <i> Times </i> bought out experienced reporters and editors and began hiring journalists from publications like the <i> HuffPost </i> who were considered \u201cdigital natives\u201d because they had never worked in print. This hiring quickly became easier, since most digital publications financed by venture capital turned out to be bad businesses. The advertising that was supposed to fund them flowed instead to the giant social-media companies. The <i> HuffPost </i> s and <i> Buzzfeed </i> s began to decay, and the <i> Times </i> \u2019s subscriptions and staff began to grow. </p><p> I have been lucky in my own career to move between local and national and international journalism, newspapers and magazines, opinion and news, and the print and digital realms. I was even luckier in these various roles to have editors with a profound understanding of their particular form and a sense of duty about teaching it. The wipeout of local papers and the desperate transformation of survivors like the <i> Times </i> have left young reporters today with fewer such opportunities. </p><p> Though they might have lacked deep or varied reporting backgrounds, some of the <i> Times </i> \u2019s new hires brought skills in video and audio; others were practised at marketing themselves \u2013 building their brands, as journalists now put it \u2013 in social media. Some were brilliant and fiercely honest, in keeping with the old aspirations of the paper. But, critically, the <i> Times </i> abandoned its practice of acculturation, including those months-long assignments on Metro covering cops and crime or housing. Many new hires who never spent time in the streets went straight into senior writing and editing roles. Meanwhile, the paper began pushing out its print-era salespeople and hiring new ones, and also hiring hundreds of engineers to build its digital infrastructure. All these recruits arrived with their own notions of the purpose of the <i> Times </i> . To me, publishing conservatives helped fulfil the paper\u2019s mission; to them, I think, it betrayed that mission. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20231213_1843_NYT_07.jpg\"><figcaption class=\"css-18w36g1 edweubf2\"><span> Dean Baquet, former executive editor of the <i> New York Times </i> addressing the newsroom </span></figcaption></figure><p> And then, to the shock and horror of the newsroom, Trump won the presidency. In his article for <i> Columbia Journalism Review </i> , Sulzberger cites the <i> Times </i> \u2019s failure to take Trump\u2019s chances seriously as an example of how \u201cprematurely shutting down inquiry and debate\u201d can allow \u201cconventional wisdom to ossify in a way that blinds society.\u201d Many <i> Times </i> staff members \u2013 scared, angry \u2013 assumed the <i> Times </i> was supposed to help lead the resistance. Anxious for growth, the <i> Times </i> \u2019s marketing team implicitly endorsed that idea, too. </p><p> As the number of subscribers ballooned, the marketing department tracked their expectations, and came to a nuanced conclusion. More than 95% of <i> Times </i> subscribers described themselves as Democrats or independents, and a vast majority of them believed the <i> Times </i> was also liberal. A similar majority applauded that bias; it had become \u201ca selling point\u201d, reported one internal marketing memo. Yet at the same time, the marketers concluded, subscribers wanted to believe that the <i> Times </i> was independent. </p><p> When you think about it, this contradiction resolves itself easily. It is human nature to want to see your bias confirmed; however, it is also human nature to want to be reassured that your bias is not just a bias, but is endorsed by journalism that is \u201cfair and balanced\u201d, as a certain Murdoch-owned cable-news network used to put it. As that memo argued, even if the <i> Times </i> was seen as politically to the left, it was critical to its brand also to be seen as broadening its readers\u2019 horizons, and that required \u201ca perception of independence\u201d. </p><p> Perception is one thing, and actual independence another. Readers could cancel their subscriptions if the <i> Times </i> challenged their worldview by reporting the truth without regard to politics. As a result, the <i> Times </i> \u2019s long-term civic value was coming into conflict with the paper\u2019s short-term shareholder value. As the cable networks have shown, you can build a decent business by appealing to the millions of Americans who comprise one of the partisan tribes of the electorate. The <i> Times </i> has every right to pursue the commercial strategy that makes it the most money. But leaning into a partisan audience creates a powerful dynamic. Nobody warned the new subscribers to the <i> Times </i> that it might disappoint them by reporting truths that conflicted with their expectations. When your product is \u201cindependent journalism\u201d, that commercial strategy is tricky, because too much independence might alienate your audience, while too little can lead to charges of hypocrisy that strike at the heart of the brand. </p><p> It became one of Dean Baquet\u2019s frequent mordant jokes that he missed the old advertising-based business model, because, compared with subscribers, advertisers felt so much less sense of ownership over the journalism. I recall his astonishment, fairly early in the Trump administration, after <i> Times </i> reporters conducted an interview with Trump. Subscribers were angry about the questions the <i> Times </i> had asked. It was as if they\u2019d only be satisfied, Baquet said, if the reporters leaped across the desk and tried to wring the president\u2019s neck. The <i> Times </i> was slow to break it to its readers that there was less to Trump\u2019s ties to Russia than they were hoping, and more to Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop, that Trump might be right that covid came from a Chinese lab, that masks were not always effective against the virus, that shutting down schools for many months was a bad idea. </p><p> In my experience, reporters overwhelmingly support Democratic policies and candidates. They are generally also motivated by a desire for a more just world. Neither of those tendencies are new. But there has been a sea change over the past ten years in how journalists think about pursuing justice. The reporters\u2019 creed used to have its foundation in liberalism, in the classic philosophical sense. The exercise of a reporter\u2019s curiosity and empathy, given scope by the constitutional protections of free speech, would equip readers with the best information to form their own judgments. The best ideas and arguments would win out. The journalist\u2019s role was to be a sworn witness; the readers\u2019 role was to be judge and jury. In its idealised form, journalism was lonely, prickly, unpopular work, because it was only through unrelenting scepticism and questioning that society could advance. If everyone the reporter knew thought X, the reporter\u2019s role was to ask: why X? </p><p> Illiberal journalists have a different philosophy, and they have their reasons for it. They are more concerned with group rights than individual rights, which they regard as a bulwark for the privileges of white men. They have seen the principle of free speech used to protect right-wing outfits like <i> Project Veritas </i> and <i> Breitbart News </i> and are uneasy with it. They had their suspicions of their fellow citizens\u2019 judgment confirmed by Trump\u2019s election, and do not believe readers can be trusted with potentially dangerous ideas or facts. They are not out to achieve social justice as the knock-on effect of pursuing truth; they want to pursue it head-on. The term \u201cobjectivity\u201d to them is code for ignoring the poor and weak and cosying up to power, as journalists often have done. </p><p> And they do not just want to be part of the cool crowd. They need to be. To be more valued by their peers and their contacts \u2013 and hold sway over their bosses \u2013 they need a lot of followers in social media. That means they must be seen to applaud the right sentiments of the right people in social media. The journalist from central casting used to be a loner, contrarian or a misfit. Now journalism is becoming another job for joiners, or, to borrow Twitter\u2019s own parlance, \u201cfollowers\u201d, a term that mocks the essence of a journalist\u2019s role. </p><p> This is a bit of a paradox. The new newsroom ideology seems idealistic, yet it has grown from cynical roots in academia: from the idea that there is no such thing as objective truth; that there is only narrative, and that therefore whoever controls the narrative \u2013 whoever gets to tell the version of the story that the public hears \u2013 has the whip hand. What matters, in other words, is not truth and ideas in themselves, but the power to determine both in the public mind. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20231213_1843_NYT_08.jpg\"></figure><p> By contrast, the old newsroom ideology seems cynical on its surface. It used to bug me that my editors at the <i> Times </i> assumed every word out of the mouth of any person in power was a lie. And the pursuit of objectivity can seem reptilian, even nihilistic, in its abjuration of a fixed position in moral contests. But the basis of that old newsroom approach was idealistic: the notion that power ultimately lies in truth and ideas, and that the citizens of a pluralistic democracy, not leaders of any sort, must be trusted to judge both. </p><p> Our role in <i> Times </i> Opinion, I used to urge my colleagues, was not to tell people what to think, but to help them fulfil their desire to think for themselves. It seems to me that putting the pursuit of truth, rather than of justice, at the top of a publication\u2019s hierarchy of values also better serves not just truth but justice, too: over the long term journalism that is not also sceptical of the advocates of any form of justice and the programmes they put forward, and that does not struggle honestly to understand and explain the sources of resistance, will not assure that those programmes will work, and it also has no legitimate claim to the trust of reasonable people who see the world very differently. Rather than advance understanding and durable change, it provokes backlash. </p><p> The impatience within the newsroom with such old ways was intensified by the generational failure of the <i> Times </i> to hire and promote women and non-white people, black people in particular. In the 1990s, and into the early part of this century, when I worked in the high-profile Washington bureau of the <i> Times </i> , usually at most two of the dozens of journalists stationed there were black. Before Baquet became executive editor, the highest-ranked black journalist at the <i> Times </i> had been my old Metro editor, Gerald Boyd. He rose to become managing editor before A.G. Sulzberger\u2019s father pushed him out, along with the executive editor, Howell Raines, when a black reporter named Jayson Blair was discovered to be a fabulist. Boyd was said to have protected Blair, an accusation he denied and attributed to racism. </p><p> The accusation against Boyd never made sense to me. In my experience he was even harder on black and brown reporters than he was on us white people. He understood better than anyone what it would take for them to succeed at the <i> Times </i> . \u201cThe <i> Times </i> was a place where blacks felt they had to convince their white peers that they were good enough to be there,\u201d he wrote in his heartbreaking memoir, published posthumously. He died in 2006 of lung cancer, three years after he was discarded. </p><p> Pay attention if you are white at the <i> Times </i> and you will hear black editors speak of hiring consultants at their own expense to figure out how to get white staff to respect them. You might hear how a black journalist, passing through the newsroom, was asked by a white colleague whether he was the \u201ctelephone guy\u201d sent to fix his extension. I certainly never got asked a question like that. Among the experienced journalists at the <i> Times </i> , black journalists were least likely, I thought, to exhibit fragility and herd behaviour. </p><p> As wave after wave of pain and outrage swept through the <i> Times </i> , over a headline that was not damning enough of Trump or someone\u2019s obnoxious tweets, I came to think of the people who were fragile, the ones who were caught up in Slack or Twitter storms, as people who had only recently discovered that they were white and were still getting over the shock. Having concluded they had got ahead by working hard, it has been a revelation to them that their skin colour was not just part of the wallpaper of American life, but a source of power, protection and advancement. They may know a lot about television, or real estate, or how to edit audio files, but their work does not take them into shelters, or police precincts, or the homes of people who see the world very differently. It has never exposed them to live fire. Their idea of violence includes vocabulary. </p><p> I share the bewilderment that so many people could back Trump, given the things he says and does, and that makes me want to understand why they do: the breadth and diversity of his support suggests not just racism is at work. Yet these elite, well-meaning <i> Times </i> staff cannot seem to stretch the empathy they are learning to extend to people with a different skin colour to include those, of whatever race, who have different politics. </p><p> The digital natives were nevertheless valuable, not only for their skills but also because they were excited for the <i> Times </i> to embrace its future. That made them important allies of the editorial and business leaders as they sought to shift the <i> Times </i> to digital journalism and to replace staff steeped in the ways of print. Partly for that reason, and partly out of fear, the leadership indulged internal attacks on <i> Times </i> journalism, despite pleas from me and others, to them and the company as a whole, that <i> Times </i> folk should treat each other with more respect. My colleagues and I in Opinion came in for a lot of the scorn, but we were not alone. Correspondents in the Washington bureau and political reporters would take a beating, too, when they were seen as committing sins like \u201cfalse balance\u201d because of the nuance in their stories. </p><p> My fellow editorial and commercial leaders were well aware of how the culture of the institution had changed. As delighted as they were by the <i> Times </i> \u2019s digital transformation they were not blind to the ideological change that came with it. They were unhappy with the bullying and group-think; we often discussed such cultural problems in the weekly meetings of the executive committee, composed of the top editorial and business leaders, including the publisher. Inevitably, these bitch sessions would end with someone saying a version of: \u201cWell, at some point we have to tell them this is what we believe in as a newspaper, and if they don\u2019t like it they should work somewhere else.\u201d It took me a couple of years to realise that this moment was never going to come. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20231213_1843_NYT_09.jpg\"><figcaption class=\"css-18w36g1 edweubf2\"><span> Arthur Sulzberger, former publisher of the <i> New York Times </i> ( <i> left </i> ) with his son A.G. Sulzberger at the <i> Times </i> building in 2017 </span></figcaption></figure><p> More than 30 years ago, a young political reporter named Todd Purdum tremulously asked an all-staff meeting what would be done about the \u201cclimate of fear\u201d within the newsroom in which reporters felt intimidated by their bosses? The moment immediately entered <i> Times </i> lore. There is a lot not to miss about the days when editors like Boyd could strike terror in young reporters like me and Purdum. But the pendulum has swung so far in the other direction that editors now tremble before their reporters and even their interns. \u201cI miss the old climate of fear,\u201d Baquet used to say with a smile, in another of his barbed jokes. </p><p><span> D </span> uring the first meeting of the <i> Times </i> board of directors that I attended, in 2016, Baquet and I hosted a joint question-and-answer session. At one point, Baquet, musing about how the <i> Times </i> was changing, observed that one of the newsroom\u2019s cultural critics had become the paper\u2019s best political-opinion columnist. Taking this musing one step further, I then noted that this raised an obvious question: why did the paper still have an Opinion department separate from the newsroom, with its own editor reporting directly to the publisher? If the newsroom was publishing the best opinion journalism at the paper \u2013 if it was publishing opinion at all \u2013 why did the <i> Times </i> maintain a separate department that falsely claimed to have a monopoly on such journalism? </p><p> Everyone laughed. But I meant it, and I wish I\u2019d pursued my point and talked myself out of the job. This contest over control of opinion journalism within the <i> Times </i> was not just a bureaucratic turf battle (though it was that, too). The newsroom\u2019s embrace of opinion journalism has compromised the <i> Times </i> \u2019s independence, misled its readers and fostered a culture of intolerance and conformity. </p><p> The Opinion department is a relic of the era when the <i> Times </i> enforced a line between news and opinion journalism. Editors in the newsroom did not touch opinionated copy, lest they be contaminated by it, and opinion journalists and editors kept largely to their own, distant floor within the <i> Times </i> building. Such fastidiousness could seem excessive, but it enforced an ethos that <i> Times </i> reporters owed their readers an unceasing struggle against bias in the news. But by the time I returned as editorial-page editor, more opinion columnists and critics were writing for the newsroom than for Opinion. As at the cable news networks, the boundaries between commentary and news were disappearing, and readers had little reason to trust that <i> Times </i> journalists were resisting rather than indulging their biases. </p><p> The <i> Times </i> newsroom had added more cultural critics, and, as Baquet noted, they were free to opine about politics. Departments across the <i> Times </i> newsroom had also begun appointing their own \u201ccolumnists\u201d, without stipulating any rules that might distinguish them from columnists in Opinion. It became a running joke. Every few months, some poor editor in the newsroom or Opinion would be tasked with writing up guidelines that would distinguish the newsroom\u2019s opinion journalists from those of Opinion, and every time they would ultimately throw up their hands. </p><p> I remember how shaken A.G. Sulzberger was one day when he was cornered by a cultural critic who had got wind that such guardrails might be put in place. The critic insisted he was an opinion writer, just like anyone in the Opinion department, and he would not be reined in. He wasn\u2019t. (I checked to see if, since I left the <i> Times </i> , it had developed guidelines explaining the difference, if any, between a news columnist and opinion columnist. The paper\u2019s spokeswoman, Danielle Rhoades Ha, did not respond to the question.) </p><p> The internet rewards opinionated work and, as news editors felt increasing pressure to generate page views, they began not just hiring more opinion writers but also running their own versions of opinionated essays by outside voices \u2013 historically, the province of Opinion\u2019s op-ed department. Yet because the paper continued to honour the letter of its old principles, none of this work could be labelled \u201copinion\u201d (it still isn\u2019t). After all, it did not come from the Opinion department. And so a newsroom technology columnist might call for, say, unionisation of the Silicon Valley workforce, as one did, or an outside writer might argue in the business section for reparations for slavery, as one did, and to the average reader their work would appear indistinguishable from <i> Times </i> news articles. </p><p> By similarly circular logic, the newsroom\u2019s opinion journalism breaks another of the <i> Times </i> \u2019s commitments to its readers. Because the newsroom officially does not do opinion \u2013 even though it openly hires and publishes opinion journalists \u2013 it feels free to ignore Opinion\u2019s mandate to provide a diversity of views. When I was editorial-page editor, there were a couple of newsroom columnists whose politics were not obvious. But the other newsroom columnists, and the critics, read as passionate progressives. </p><p> I urged Baquet several times to add a conservative to the newsroom roster of cultural critics. That would serve the readers by diversifying the <i> Times </i> \u2019s analysis of culture, where the paper\u2019s left-wing bias had become most blatant, and it would show that the newsroom also believed in restoring the <i> Times </i> \u2019s commitment to taking conservatives seriously. He said this was a good idea, but he never acted on it. I couldn\u2019t help trying the idea out on one of the paper\u2019s top cultural editors, too: he told me he did not think <i> Times </i> readers would be interested in that point of view. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20231213_1843_NYT_10.jpg\"></figure><p> As the <i> Times </i> tried to compete for more readers online, homogenous opinion was spreading through the newsroom in other ways. News desks were urging reporters to write in the first person and to use more \u201cvoice\u201d, but few newsroom editors had experience in handling that kind of journalism, and no one seemed certain where \u201cvoice\u201d stopped and \u201copinion\u201d began. The <i> Times </i> magazine, meanwhile, became a crusading progressive publication. Baquet liked to say the magazine was Switzerland, by which he meant that it sat between the newsroom and Opinion. But it reported only to the news side. Its work was not labelled as opinion and it was free to omit conservative viewpoints. </p><p> This creep of politics into the newsroom\u2019s journalism helped the <i> Times </i> beat back some of its new challengers, at least those on the left. Competitors like <i> Vox </i> and the <i> HuffPost </i> were blending leftish politics with reporting and writing it up conversationally in the first person. Imitating their approach, along with hiring some of their staff, helped the <i> Times </i> repel them. But it came at a cost. The rise of opinion journalism over the past 15 years changed the newsroom\u2019s coverage and its culture. The tiny redoubt of never-Trump conservatives in Opinion is swamped daily not only by the many progressives in that department but their reinforcements among the critics, columnists and magazine writers in the newsroom. They are generally excellent, but their homogeneity means <i> Times </i> readers are being served a very restricted range of views, some of them presented as straight news by a publication that still holds itself out as independent of any politics. And because the critics, newsroom columnists and magazine writers are the newsroom\u2019s most celebrated journalists, they have disproportionate influence over the paper\u2019s culture. </p><p> And yet the <i> Times </i> insists to the public that nothing has changed. By saying that it still holds itself to the old standard of strictly separating its news and opinion journalists, the paper leads its readers further into the trap of thinking that what they are reading is independent and impartial \u2013 and this misleads them about their country\u2019s centre of political and cultural gravity. \u201cEven though each day\u2019s opinion pieces are typically among our most popular journalism and our columnists are among our most trusted voices, we believe opinion is secondary to our primary mission of reporting and should represent only a portion of a healthy news diet,\u201d Sulzberger wrote in the <i> Columbia Journalism Review. </i> \u201cFor that reason, we\u2019ve long kept the Opinion department intentionally small \u2013 it represents well under a tenth of our journalistic staff \u2013 and ensured that its editorial decision-making is walled off from the newsroom.\u201d </p><p> When I was editorial-page editor, Sulzberger, who declined to be interviewed on the record for this article, worried a great deal about the breakdown in the boundaries between news and opinion. At one town hall, he was confronted by a staffer upset that we in Opinion had begun doing more original reporting, which was a priority for me. Sulzberger replied he was much less worried about reporting in the Opinion coverage than by opinion in the news report \u2013 a fine moment, I thought then and think now, in his leadership. He told me once that he would like to restructure the paper to have one editor oversee all its news reporters, another all its opinion journalists and a third all its service journalists, the ones who supply guidance on buying gizmos or travelling abroad. Each of these editors would report to him. That is the kind of action the <i> Times </i> needs to take now to confront its hypocrisy and begin restoring its independence. </p><p> The <i> Times </i> could learn something from the <i> Wall Street Journal </i> , which has kept its journalistic poise. It has maintained a stricter separation between its news and opinion journalism, including its cultural criticism, and that has protected the integrity of its work. After I was chased out of the <i> Times </i> , <i> Journal </i> reporters and other staff attempted a similar assault on their opinion department. Some 280 of them signed a letter listing pieces they found offensive and demanding changes in how their opinion colleagues approached their work. \u201cTheir anxieties aren\u2019t our responsibility,\u201d shrugged the <i> Journal </i> \u2019s editorial board in a note to readers after the letter was leaked. \u201cThe signers report to the news editors or other parts of the business.\u201d The editorial added, in case anyone missed the point, \u201cWe are not the <i> New York Times </i> .\u201d That was the end of it. </p><p> Unlike the publishers of the <i> Journal </i> , however, Sulzberger is in a bind, or at least perceives himself to be. The confusion within the <i> Times </i> over its role, and the rising tide of intolerance among the reporters, the engineers, the business staff, even the subscribers \u2013 these are all problems he inherited, in more ways than one. He seems to feel constrained in confronting the paper\u2019s illiberalism by the very source of his authority. He is sensitive about the idiosyncratic way he reached the pinnacle of American news media, via his family\u2019s control of the paper\u2019s voting stock. Once, when I told him we were preparing an editorial series on nepotism within the Trump White House, he was quick to note that the <i> Times </i> was in a glass house when it came to such criticism. </p><p> The paradox is that in previous generations the Sulzbergers\u2019 control was the bulwark of the paper\u2019s independence. For this publisher, it seems also to be a vulnerability. He noted in the <i> Columbia Journalism Review </i> that he is \u201ca wealthy white man who succeeded a series of other wealthy white men with the same first and last name.\u201d His background, he wrote, may make him \u201cuniquely, perhaps even comically, unpersuasive\u201d in the debate over journalistic principles. That confession read like throat-clearing before his lengthy exposition of \u201cindependent journalism\u201d, and it is right for people to be aware of the blinders and biases created by their upbringing. But if he is going to instil the principles he believes in, he needs to stop worrying so much about his powers of persuasion, and start using the power he is so lucky to have. </p><p><span> T </span> om Cotton had written two op-eds for us in Opinion, making the case for buying Greenland and defending Trump\u2019s decision to assassinate the head of the Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, General Qassem Suleimani. Adam Rubenstein, a rising talent in Opinion, had helped edit the second of these pieces. Rubenstein had brought in dozens of op-eds by then that reflected a variety of voices, ideas and politics, and had received a note of praise from Sulzberger himself, for a piece by a former congressman, Joe Walsh, a Tea Party favourite who had called for a primary challenge to Trump. But Rubenstein had a background in conservative journalism, and within the <i> Times </i> his work in soliciting pieces from conservatives had put a target on his back. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20231213_1843_NYT_11.jpg\"><figcaption class=\"css-18w36g1 edweubf2\"><span> Donald Trump with Cotton ( <i> left </i> ) speaking at the White House in 2017 </span></figcaption></figure><p> In early June 2020 Cotton\u2019s office pitched a piece about Twitter\u2019s curation of its platform. Cotton had tweeted that Trump should call out troops to stop the \u201canarchy, rioting and looting\u201d if \u201clocal law enforcement is overwhelmed\u201d, and Twitter had threatened to censor his account. Jim Dao, the op-ed editor, was more interested in the substance of the tweet and, via Rubenstein, asked Cotton to write an op-ed about that. </p><p> That was the right thing to do. Trump was starting to call for the use of troops, and on May 31st the mayor of Washington, DC, had requested that the National Guard be deployed in her city. After police gassed protesters before Trump posed for a photo in Lafayette Square on June 1st, the editorial board, which I led, weighed in against that use of force and Trump\u2019s \u201cincendiary behaviour\u201d, and the op-ed team had pieces planned for June 3rd arguing he did not have a sound basis to call out federal forces and would be wrong to do so. In keeping with the basic practice of the op-ed page, which was created to present points of view at odds with <i> Times </i> editorials, Dao owed readers the counter-argument. They also needed to know someone so influential with the president was making this argument, and how he was making it. </p><p> I knew the piece was coming, and that Dao had asked for substantive revisions to the first draft. At the time, Rubenstein was assisting me with research for a daily newsletter I was writing, and I asked him when we met on the morning of June 3rd to make sure Cotton was distinguishing clearly between rioters and protesters. He did: \u201cA majority who seek to protest peacefully shouldn\u2019t be confused with bands of miscreants,\u201d Cotton wrote. From Cotton\u2019s perspective, it was leftist elites who were confusing the two. In the op-ed, he decried any \u201crevolting moral equivalence of rioters and looters to peaceful, law-abiding protesters\u201d. </p><p> Rubenstein also told me that in one draft Cotton had linked disapprovingly to a tweet from a <i> Times </i> reporter that could be read as expressing support for the rioters. I told Rubenstein to make sure that this link was removed. I had prohibited criticising any work, including any social-media activity, from the newsroom, unless I ran the idea by a senior newsroom editor first. </p><p> Shortly after we published the op-ed that Wednesday afternoon, some reporters tweeted their opposition to Cotton\u2019s argument. But the real action was in the <i> Times </i> \u2019s Slack channels, where reporters and other staff began not just venting but organising. They turned to the union to draw up a workplace complaint about the op-ed. At least one of the reporters who covered news media took a strong position in this internal debate: \u201cAmplifying a message that argues for MORE force only puts our own people in harm\u2019s way, and undermines the paper\u2019s commitment to their safety,\u201d this reporter argued to colleagues in Slack, going on to offer suggestions for how the union should attack the op-ed: \u201cI think it\u2019s good that a lot of us will put our names on a strong condemnation.\u201d </p><p> The next day, this reporter shared the byline on the <i> Times </i> story about the op-ed. That article did not mention that Cotton had distinguished between \u201cpeaceful, law-abiding protesters\u201d and \u201crioters and looters\u201d. In fact, the first sentence reported that Cotton had called for \u201cthe military to suppress protests against police violence\u201d. </p><p> This was \u2013 and is \u2013 wrong. You don\u2019t have to take my word for that. You can take the <i> Times </i> \u2019s. Three days later in its article on my resignation it also initially reported that Cotton had called \u201cfor military force against protesters in American cities\u201d. This time, after the article was published on the <i> Times </i> website, the editors scrambled to rewrite it, replacing \u201cmilitary force\u201d with \u201cmilitary response\u201d and \u201cprotesters\u201d with \u201ccivic unrest\u201d. That was a weaselly adjustment \u2013 Cotton wrote about criminality, not \u201cunrest\u201d \u2013 but the article at least no longer unambiguously misrepresented Cotton\u2019s argument to make it seem he was in favour of crushing democratic protest. The <i> Times </i> did not publish a correction or any note acknowledging the story had been changed. </p><p> Seeking to influence the outcome of a story you cover, particularly without disclosing that to the reader, violates basic principles I was raised on at the <i> Times </i> . I asked the <i> Times </i> if the media reporter\u2019s behaviour was ethical. The spokeswoman, Ms Rhoades Ha, did not answer the question but instead wrote in an email that the reporter was assigned to the story after posting the messages in Slack and the \u201ceditors were unaware of those Slack messages\u201d. The reporter, apparently asked by the <i> Times </i> to write to me, immediately followed with an email that said: \u201cIn the heat of the moment, I made comments on an internal Slack channel that, as a media reporter, I should not have\u201d but that \u201cthe factual reporting I contributed to the story is not at issue.\u201d (I am not naming this journalist because I do not want to point the finger at a single reporter when, in my view, an editor should be taking responsibility for the coverage.) Ms Rhoades Ha disputes my characterisation of the after-the-fact editing of the story about my resignation. She said the editors changed the story after it was published on the website in order to \u201crefine\u201d it and \u201cadd context\u201d, and so the story did not merit a correction disclosing to the reader that changes had been made. </p><p> I asked if it was accurate and fair to report that Cotton called for \u201cthe military to suppress protests against police violence\u201d, as the June 4th story still does. In response, Ms Rhoades Ha supplied an opinion from a <i> Times </i> lawyer which noted that Cotton called for a military presence to \u201cdeter lawbreakers\u201d. The lawyer argued that because some protesters violated curfews, failed to get permits or disperse when police ordered them to, they could be considered \u201clawbreakers\u201d, just like the rioters and looters Cotton explicitly referred to. I followed up, saying I was seeking an editorial rather than a legal opinion, and asking again whether the <i> Times </i> believed its characterisation of Cotton\u2019s argument was not just accurate, but fair. Ms Rhoades Ha again referred me to the lawyer\u2019s opinion. </p><p> She also defended the <i> Times </i> more broadly: \u201cThe <i> New York Times </i> believes unequivocally in the principle of independence, as has been demonstrated consistently by our journalism before and since that episode. There are countless examples of the <i> Times </i> standing strong against pressure and protest, whether from governments, companies, politicians, activist groups or even internally. In the case of the Tom Cotton op-ed, the handling of such a sensitive piece, specifically the decision to rush it into publication without key leaders having read it because it was \u201cnewsy\u201d, made it unusually vulnerable to attack. Good principles, as the Cotton op-ed demonstrated, cannot be an excuse for bad execution.\u201d </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20231213_1843_NYT_12.jpg\"><figcaption class=\"css-18w36g1 edweubf2\"><span> A man smashing a cash register following the death of George Floyd in 2020 </span></figcaption></figure><p> In retrospect what seems almost comical is that as the conflict over Cotton\u2019s op-ed unfolded within the <i> Times </i> I acted as though it was on the level, as though the staff of the <i> Times </i> would have a good-faith debate about Cotton\u2019s piece and the decision to publish it. Instead, people wanted to vent and achieve what they considered to be justice, whether through Twitter, Slack, the union or the news pages themselves. Engaging with them at all was a mistake. That first night after the op-ed was published, when I called Baquet, his sage advice was to say nothing. Give it time, he said. Let this play out. The publisher disagreed. He thought we needed to say something that night explaining why we chose to publish the piece, and so we kept heaping more logs on the fire. </p><p> My colleagues in Opinion, together with the <small> PR </small> team, put together a series of connected tweets describing the purpose behind publishing Cotton\u2019s op-ed. Rather than publish these tweets from the generic <i> Times </i> Opinion Twitter account, Sulzberger encouraged me to do it from my personal one, on the theory that this would humanise our defence. I doubted that would make any difference, but it was certainly my job to take responsibility. So I sent out the tweets, sticking my head in a Twitter bucket that clangs, occasionally, to this day. At the publisher\u2019s direction, I then wrote an explanation of the decision to publish the op-ed for the next day\u2019s edition of the Opinion newsletter. Reading that piece now, I think it holds up. It was not defensive and it dealt with the strongest criticisms. It concluded with a sentiment that I\u2019ve always thought journalists should bring to all their work, and which I intended as an invitation to debate. (\u201cIt is impossible to feel righteous about any of this. I know that my own view may be wrong.\u201d) But no one took me up on that. </p><p><span> W </span> hat is worth recalling now from the bedlam of the next two days? I suppose there might be lessons for someone interested in how not to manage a corporate crisis. I began making my own mistakes that Thursday. The union condemned our publication of Cotton, for supposedly putting journalists in danger, claiming that he had called on the military \u201cto \u2018detain\u2019 and \u2018subdue\u2019 Americans protesting racism and police brutality\u201d \u2013 again, a misrepresentation of his argument. The publisher called to tell me the company was experiencing its largest sick day in history; people were turning down job offers because of the op-ed, and, he said, some people were quitting. He had been expecting for some time that the union would seek a voice in editorial decision-making; he said he thought this was the moment the union was making its move. He had clearly changed his own mind about the value of publishing the Cotton op-ed. </p><p> I asked Dao to have our fact-checkers review the union\u2019s claims. But then I went a step further: at the publisher\u2019s request, I urged him to review the editing of the piece itself and come back to me with a list of steps we could have taken to make it better. Dao\u2019s reflex \u2013 the correct one \u2013 was to defend the piece as published. He and three other editors of varying ages, genders and races had helped edit it; it had been fact-checked, as is all our work. But I resisted, worried that we had put Sulzberger in a hard position. In Opinion we had grown accustomed to the wrath of our colleagues, but this time the publisher was in the line of fire as well. </p><p> I told myself there was nothing false about this. There isn\u2019t an article out of the many thousands I have written or edited that I do not think, in retrospect, could have met a higher standard in some way \u2013 and Cotton\u2019s op-ed is no exception. And I thought that by saying we could have somehow made the piece better, we would dispel the heat within the <i> Times </i> but affirm the principle that it was the kind of piece we should publish. This was my last failed attempt to have the debate within the <i> Times </i> that I had been seeking for four years, about why it was important to present <i> Times </i> readers with arguments like Cotton\u2019s. The staff at the paper never wanted to have that debate. The Cotton uproar was the most extreme version of the internal reaction we faced whenever we published conservative arguments that were not simply anti-Trump. Yes, yes, of course we believe in the principle of publishing diverse views, my <i> Times </i> colleagues would say, but why <i> this </i> conservative? Why <i> this </i> argument? </p><p> Most of the union\u2019s assertions were wrong, but in going back over the piece the fact-checker did find a minor error. Cotton had accidentally left some words from a legal opinion in quotation marks that he should have put in his own voice. Dao also dutifully itemised language that we might have softened, and said the headline, \u201cSend in the Troops\u201d should in retrospect have been made more palatable, if duller. I doubt these changes would have mattered, and to extract this list from Dao was to engage in precisely the hypocrisy I claimed to despise \u2013 that, in fact, I do despise. If Cotton needed to be held to such standards of politesse, so did everyone else. Headlines such as \u201cTom Cotton\u2019s Fascist Op-ed\u201d, the headline of a subsequent piece, should also have been tranquillised. </p><p> As that miserable Thursday wore on, Sulzberger, Baquet and I held a series of Zoom meetings with reporters and editors from the newsroom who wanted to discuss the op-ed. Though a handful of the participants were there to posture, these were generally constructive conversations. A couple of people, including Baquet, even had the guts to speak up in favour of publishing the op-ed. Two moments stick out. At one point, in answer to a question, Sulzberger and Baquet both said they thought the op-ed \u2013 as the <i> Times </i> union and many journalists were saying \u2013 had in fact put journalists in danger. That was the first time I realised I might be coming to the end of the road. The other was when a pop-culture reporter asked if I had read the op-ed before it was published. I said I had not. He immediately put his head down and started typing, and I should have paid attention rather than moving on to the next question. He was evidently sharing the news with the company over Slack. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20231213_1843_NYT_13.jpg\"><figcaption class=\"css-18w36g1 edweubf2\"><span> Baquet ( <i> second left </i> ) and Bennet ( <i> third left </i> ) applauding a Pulitzer-prize winner from the <i> Times </i> in 2019 </span></figcaption></figure><p> If he had followed up, or I had, I might have explained that this was standard practice. Dao\u2019s name was on the masthead of the <i> New York Times </i> because he was in charge of the op-ed section. If I insisted on reviewing every piece, I would have been doing his job for him \u2013 and been betraying a crippling lack of trust in one of the papers\u2019 finest editors. After I departed, and other Opinion staff quit or were reassigned, the <i> Times </i> later made him Metro editor, a sign of its own continued confidence in him. Every job review I had at the <i> Times </i> urged me to step back from the daily coverage to focus on the long term. (Hilariously, one review, urging me to move faster in upending the Opinion department, instructed me to take risks and \u201cask for forgiveness not permission\u201d.) </p><p> It was important to me to read pieces in advance that might cause an uproar, and I had asked Dao and his deputy to alert me to any they thought would be particularly sensitive, but they did not think the Cotton piece rose to that level. I had also instituted an \u201cif-you-see-something-say-something\u201d policy in Opinion as a whole. Nobody raised a red flag with me. To be clear \u2013 I don\u2019t fault anyone for this; I mention it only as an index of how much easier it was to judge in hindsight, after publication, when a piece was explosive. In any event, if anyone had raised an alarm, I might have edited the piece differently, but that would not have changed the outcome. Given the pieces we had already published and planned to publish opposing the position Cotton argued, we would still have published it \u2013 it was, in my view at the time, the kind of viewpoint the Sulzbergers had said they wanted to see also represented in the <i> Times </i> . And the critics would hardly have been mollified had it been more persuasive. </p><p> I learned when these meetings were over that there had been a new eruption in Slack. <i> Times </i> staff were saying that Rubenstein had been the sole editor of the op-ed. In response, Dao had gone into Slack to clarify to the entire company that he had also edited it himself. But when the <i> Times </i> posted the news article that evening, it reported, \u201cThe Op-Ed was edited by Adam Rubenstein\u201d and made no mention of Dao\u2019s statement. One of the ironies of this episode was that it was not any newsroom reporter but Rubenstein who wound up receiving death threats because of the Cotton op-ed, and it was the newsroom that put him in harm\u2019s way. I would put <i> Times </i> Opinion\u2019s standards for the editing of Cotton\u2019s op-ed up against the <i> Times </i> newsroom\u2019s standards for its coverage of the op-ed any day of the week. </p><p> By unhappy \u2013 but, really, also quite funny \u2013 coincidence, a meeting of the entire company had been scheduled over Zoom for the next morning. The plan had been for the newsroom to talk about its coverage of the protests. Now the only subject was going to be the op-ed. Early that morning, I got an email from Sam Dolnick, a Sulzberger cousin and a top editor at the paper, who said he felt \u201cwe\u201d \u2013 he could have only meant me \u2013 owed the whole staff \u201can apology for appearing to place an abstract idea like open debate over the value of our colleagues\u2019 lives, and their safety\u201d. He was worried that I and my colleagues had unintentionally sent a message to other people at the <i> Times </i> that: \u201cWe don\u2019t care about their full humanity and their security as much as we care about our ideas.\u201d </p><p> Like his cousin, the publisher, Dolnick is a smart guy with a good heart, and I know he meant well. But I was staggered by his email, by how different his conception was of the role of journalism, and of my own commitment to it. Did he really think I saw this as an academic exercise, or some kind of game? My mother survived the Holocaust in Poland, and it took years for her and the remnant of our family to be admitted to the United States. Did he really think I believed ideas had no consequences for people\u2019s lives? I guess I was also fed up. I wrote to the publisher, who had been copied in on Dolnick\u2019s note. </p><p> \u201cI know you don\u2019t like it when I talk about principles at a moment like this,\u201d I began. But I viewed the journalism I had been doing, at the <i> Times </i> and before that at the <i> Atlantic </i> , in very different terms from the ones Dolnick presumed. \u201cI don\u2019t think of our work as an abstraction without meaning for people\u2019s lives \u2013 quite the opposite,\u201d I continued. \u201cThe whole point \u2013 the reason I do this \u2013 is to have an impact on their lives to the good. I have always believed that putting ideas, including potentially dangerous one[s], out in the public is vital to ensuring they are debated and, if dangerous, discarded.\u201d It was, I argued, in \u201cedge cases like this that principles are tested\u201d, and if my position was judged wrong then \u201cI am out of step with the times.\u201d But, I concluded, \u201cI don\u2019t think of us as some kind of debating society without implications for the real world and I\u2019ve never been unmindful of my colleagues\u2019 humanity.\u201d </p><p> Sulzberger did not reply. But in the end, one thing he and I surely agree on is that I was, in fact, out of step with the <i> Times </i> . It may have raised me as a journalist \u2013 and invested so much in educating me to what were once its standards \u2013 but I did not belong there any more. </p><p> In retrospect, it seems clear that I was done by then. The executive committee gathered that morning to prepare, and for the first time I was not invited to join them. They had solicited questions in advance, and I got a glimpse at the list only as the company-wide meeting was about to start. I did not hear from Sulzberger, but the speechwriter who drafted many of his remarks, Alex Levy, contacted me just before the meeting began to tell me to use whatever question I got first to apologise, and at some point to acknowledge my privilege. </p><p> A Zoom call with a couple of thousand people is a disorienting experience, particularly when many of them are not particularly mindful of your \u201cfull humanity\u201d. I do not recommend it. As my first turn to speak came up, I was still struggling with what I should apologise for. I was not going to apologise for denying my colleagues\u2019 humanity or endangering their lives. I had not done those things. I was not going to apologise for publishing the op-ed. Finally, I came up with something that felt true. I told the meeting that I was sorry for the pain that my leadership of Opinion had caused. What a pathetic thing to say. I did not think to add, because I\u2019d lost track of this truth myself by then, that opinion journalism that never causes pain is not journalism. It can\u2019t hope to move society forward. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20231213_1843_NYT_15.jpg\"><figcaption class=\"css-18w36g1 edweubf2\"><span> A Black Lives Matter protest in New York, four days after George Floyd\u2019s death, on May 15th 2020 </span></figcaption></figure><p> Baquet spoke movingly about how, as a black man, he was vulnerable in ways a white man was not when he left his apartment wearing a hoodie and a mask, to ward off covid. Speaking into the void, via the unblinking eye above my computer screen, I said I knew, as a white man, I was in a very different position. When I stepped out into the street, I was protected by my privilege. But I added that I did know what it was like to be a reporter out in the field, alone, surrounded by armed, hostile people. I knew what it was like to be shot at, and to see a fellow journalist shot in front of me. And so I took to heart the criticism that I\u2019d endangered my colleagues. I\u2019d been raised \u2013 raised at the <i> Times </i> \u2013 to believe the best way to confront ideas that some people might consider dangerous was to bring them out into the open. But I recognised that many of my colleagues thought that was wrong. And I said I would like to debate with them whether it was time to discard the old approach, and, if that was the case, what role opinion journalism should have at the <i> Times </i> . </p><p> As I look back at my notes of that awful day, I don\u2019t regret what I said. Even during that meeting, I was still hoping the blow-up might at last give me the chance either to win support for what I had been asked to do, or to clarify once and for all that the rules for journalism had changed at the <i> Times </i> . </p><p> But no one wanted to talk about that. Nor did they want to hear about all the voices of vulnerable or underprivileged people we had been showcasing in Opinion, or the ambitious new journalism we were doing. Instead, my <i> Times </i> colleagues demanded to know things such as the names of every editor who had had a role in the Cotton piece. Having seen what happened to Rubenstein I refused to tell them. A Slack channel had been set up to solicit feedback in real time during the meeting, and it was filling with hate. The meeting ran long, and finally came to a close after 90 minutes. </p><p> One last dismal task lay ahead. I had agreed to take the rare step of posting an \u201cEditor\u2019s Note\u201d on the Cotton op-ed describing what was supposedly wrong with it, and the publisher had asked a newsroom editor to draft it for him. Although I had urged Dao to come up with \u201cprocess\u201d criticisms, I tried to insist, as did Dao, that the note make clear the Cotton piece was within our editorial bounds. Sulzberger said he felt the <i> Times </i> could afford to be \u201csilent\u201d on that question. In the end the note went far further in repudiating the piece than I anticipated, saying it should never have been published at all. The next morning I was told to resign. </p><p><span> W </span> hat an intense period that was, inside the <i> Times </i> and across America. In spring 2020 covid-19 chased people into their homes in fear, and then, as spring turned to summer, the murder of George Floyd brought many of them out into the streets in anger. Or maybe the emotions were the other way around. We were also angry at the virus, and at the government\u2019s handling of it, and at our employers; and we were afraid of the police, or of the rioters, or of white people or black people, Democrats or Republicans. It was a terrible moment for the country. By the traditional \u2013 and perverse \u2013 logic of journalism, that should also have made it an inspiring time to be a reporter, writer or editor. Journalists are supposed to run towards scenes that others are fleeing, towards hard truths others need to know, towards consequential ideas they would prefer to ignore. </p><p> But fear got all mixed up with anger inside the <i> Times </i> , too, along with a desire to act locally in solidarity with the national movement. That energy found a focus in the Cotton op-ed. Scattered as we were by covid, none of us at the <i> Times </i> could speak face to face, and nobody was thinking very clearly. That seems understandable, given the frantic pile-up of circumstances. It would be reasonable now for all of us \u2013 me, Sulzberger, the journalists who were declaring their fright on Twitter \u2013 to look back, shake our heads and say that was a crazy time, and we all made some mistakes. </p><p> But the <i> Times </i> is not good at acknowledging mistakes. Indeed, one of my own, within the <i> Times </i> culture, was to take responsibility for any mistakes my department made, and even some it didn\u2019t. To Sulzberger, the meltdown over Cotton\u2019s op-ed and my departure in disgrace are explained and justified by a failure of editorial \u201cprocess\u201d. As he put it in an interview with the <i> New Yorker </i> this summer, after publishing his piece in the <i> Columbia Journalism Review </i> , Cotton\u2019s piece was not \u201cperfectly fact-checked\u201d and the editors had not \u201cthought about the headline and presentation\u201d. He contrasted the execution of Cotton\u2019s opinion piece with that of a months-long investigation the newsroom did of Donald Trump\u2019s taxes (which was not \u201cperfectly fact-checked\u201d, as it happens \u2013 it required a correction). He did not explain why, if the <i> Times </i> was an independent publication, an op-ed making a mainstream conservative argument should have to meet such different standards from an op-ed making any other kind of argument, such as for the abolition of the police. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough just to have the principle and wave it around,\u201d he said. \u201cYou also have to execute on it.\u201d </p><p> To me, extolling the virtue of independent journalism in the pages of the <i> Columbia Journalism Review </i> is how you wave a principle around. Publishing a piece like Cotton\u2019s is how you execute on it. As Sulzberger also wrote in the <i> Review </i> , \u201cIndependent journalism, especially in a pluralistic democracy, should err on the side of treating areas of serious political contest as open, unsettled, and in need of further inquiry.\u201d It matters that conflicting views do not just appear before different audiences in politically rivalrous publications or cable news networks, but instead in the same forum, before the same readers, subject to the same standards for fact and argumentation. That is also, by the way, an important means by which politicians, like Cotton, can learn, by speaking to audiences who are not inclined to nod along with them. That was our ambition for <i> Times </i> Opinion \u2013 or mine, I guess. Americans can shout about their lack of free speech all they want, but they will never be able to overcome their differences, and deal with any of their real problems, if they do not learn to listen to each other again. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20231213_1843_NYT_14.jpg\"><figcaption class=\"css-18w36g1 edweubf2\"><span> Baquet outside the <i> New York Times </i> building in 2019 </span></figcaption></figure><p> If Sulzberger must insist on comparing the execution of the Cotton op-ed with that of the most ambitious of newsroom projects, let him compare it with something really important, the 1619 Project, which commemorated the 400th anniversary of the arrival of enslaved Africans in Virginia. Like Cotton\u2019s piece, the 1619 Project was fact-checked and copy-edited (most of the <i> Times </i> newsroom does not fact-check or copy-edit articles, but the magazine does). But it nevertheless contained mistakes, as journalism often does. Some of these mistakes ignited a firestorm among historians and other readers. </p><p> And, like Cotton\u2019s piece, the 1619 Project was presented in a way the <i> Times </i> later judged to be too provocative. The <i> Times </i> declared that the 1619 Project \u201caims to reframe the country\u2019s history, understanding 1619 as our true founding\u201d. That bold statement \u2013 a declaration of <i> Times </i> fact, not opinion, since it came from the newsroom \u2013 outraged many Americans who venerated 1776 as the founding. The <i> Times </i> later stealthily erased it from the digital version of the project, but was caught doing so by a writer for the publication <i> Quillette </i> . Sulzberger told me during the initial uproar that the top editors in the newsroom \u2013 not just Baquet but his deputy \u2013 had not reviewed the audacious statement of purpose, one of the biggest editorial claims the paper has ever made. They also, of course, did not edit all the pieces themselves, trusting the magazine\u2019s editors to do that work. </p><p> If the 1619 Project and the Cotton op-ed shared the same supposed flaws and excited similar outrage, how come that one is lauded as a landmark success and the other is a sackable offence? In asking this, I am not running down the 1619 Project. It was excellent, above all because it made arguments readers should hear and consider. And to be clear: unlike Sulzberger, I do not see any equivalence between any huge project like that and a single op-ed piece. The parallel is absurd. I am comparing them only to meet Sulzberger on his terms, in order to illuminate what he is trying to elide. What distinguished the Cotton piece was not an error, or strong language, or that I didn\u2019t edit it personally. What distinguished that op-ed was not process. It was politics. It is one thing for the <i> Times </i> to aggravate historians, or conservatives, or even old-school liberals who believe in open debate. It has become quite another for the <i> Times </i> to challenge some members of its own staff with ideas that might contradict their view of the world. </p><p> The lessons of the incident are not about how to write a headline but about how much the <i> Times </i> has changed \u2013 how digital technology, the paper\u2019s new business model and the rise of new ideals among its staff have altered its understanding of the boundary between news and opinion, and of the relationship between truth and justice. Ejecting me was one way to avoid confronting the question of which values the <i> Times </i> is committed to. Waving around the word \u201cprocess\u201d is another. </p><p> What still seems most striking about the Cotton episode is how out of sync the leaders of the paper were with the ascendant, illiberal values within it. Cotton\u2019s essay brought into focus conflicts over the role of journalism that had been growing within the <i> Times </i> for years, and that the leadership has largely ducked away from. Is it journalism\u2019s role to salt wounds or to salve them, to promote debates or settle them, to ask or to answer? Is its proper posture humble or righteous? As journalists trained in what was once the conventional way, with the old set of principles, Sulzberger, Baquet and I reacted similarly to Cotton\u2019s essay: here\u2019s a potentially consequential idea from an influential voice. It may make readers uncomfortable, and they should know about it and evaluate it partly for that very reason. </p><p><i> Times </i> colleagues who were frightened or angry about the piece had the opposite view: that readers should not hear Cotton\u2019s argument. To expose them to it was to risk that they might be persuaded by an elected politician. </p><p> As he asserts the independence of <i> Times </i><i> Times </i><i> New Yorker </i></p><p><i> Times </i></p><p><i> Times </i><i> Times </i></p><p><i> Times </i><i> Times </i></p><p><i> Times </i><i> Times </i><i> Washington Post </i><i> Times </i><i> Times </i><i> Times </i></p><p><b> James Bennet </b> is </p>",

Some are worried about losing their jobs, while others say the technology could be used for nefarious purposes.\nAI systems used in recruitment and judicial processes  also risk perpetuating biases  , as the training data they use could be encoded with socio-economic, racial, religious and gender prejudices, experts say.\nAt the same time, the potential of using AI to do good is also there - from driving automation to predicting illness.\nAgainst this backdrop, a  race for AI regulation is taking place  to avert the risks while hopefully reaping the rewards - with action being taken at the global, regional and national levels.\nAn international milestone was logged just a month ago. The first-ever AI Safety Summit, held in the UK on Nov 1, saw the US and China coming together with more than 25 other countries to affirm the safe and responsible use of AI.\nThe landmark agreement also places \"strong responsibility\" on developers of frontier AI to test their systems for safety.\nFrontier AI often refers to the first wave of mainstream AI applications like ChatGPT.\nOn a regional scale, the European Union is in the  final stages of formulating its AI Act  , a far-reaching law that would classify AI systems by risk and mandate various development and use requirements.\nCloser to home, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is planning to  draw up governance and ethics guidelines  for AI, which analysts told CNA are expected to suggest \"safeguards\" that can mitigate identified risks.\nWhile the guide is not expected to translate into regional legislation, it could spur individual member states to create new laws or tweak existing ones to regulate the technology, they added.\nCountries behind the AI curve will also get a leg up as they can benefit from the sharing of knowledge.\n\"The public  should care about AI regulation  because the technology is more pervasive than we normally think,\" said Dr Karryl Sagun-Trajano, a research fellow for future issues and technology at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), pointing out that AI is used in sectors like healthcare, education, transport and crime fighting.\n\nIS AI COMING FOR YOUR JOB?\nThe potential for AI to upend the labour market and disrupt industries has been much discussed. A Goldman Sachs report predicts that as many as 300 million jobs could be impacted by AI automation.\nObservers have warned that faster, smarter and cheaper AI-powered chatbots could replace outsourced call centres handling customer service for many companies.\nThis is especially stark for countries like India and the Philippines, where call centres provide modest-paying work and surveys have shown automation could render over a million jobs obsolete."

It mentions specific examples such as chatbots using large-language-model technology, AI-powered song creation, text-to-video conversion programs, and the integration of AI bots into consumer products such as Expedia, Instacart, and OpenTable. Additionally, it discusses the concerns and expectations surrounding the widespread adoption of AI, including its potential impact on the economy and global GDP. Therefore, the article is relevant to the user's query.",
                    "relevant content": "T  he age  of  \"generative\" artificial intelligence  has well and truly arrived. Open  ai  's chatbots, which use large-language-model (  llm  ) technology, got the ball rolling in November. Now barely a day goes by without some  mind-blowing advance  . An  ai  -powered song featuring a fake \"Drake\" and \"The Weeknd\" recently shook the music industry. Programs which convert text to video are making fairly convincing content. Before long consumer products such as Expedia, Instacart and OpenTable will plug into Open  ai  's bots, allowing people to order food or book a holiday by typing text into a box. A recently leaked presentation, reportedly from a Google engineer, suggests the tech giant is worried about how easy it is for rivals to make progress. There is more to comeprobably a lot more.\nThe development of  ai  raises profound questions. Perhaps most pressing, though, is a straightforward one. What does this mean for the economy? Many have grand expectations. New research by Goldman Sachs, a bank, suggests that \"widespread  ai  adoption could eventually drive a 7% or almost $7trn increase in annual global  gdp  over a ten-year period.\" Academic studies point to a three-percentage-point rise in annual labour-productivity growth in firms that adopt the technology, which would represent a huge uplift in incomes compounded over many years. A study published in 2021 by Tom Davidson of Open Philanthropy, a grantmaking outfit, puts a more than 10% chance on \"explosive growth\"defined as increases in global output of more than 30% a yearsometime this century. A few economists, only half-jokingly, hold out the possibility of global incomes becoming infinite."

                            "text": "New sorts of transistors can eke out a few more iterations of Moore\u2019s law, but they will get increasingly expensive\nTHANKS to the exponential power of Moore\u2019s law, the electronic components that run modern computers vastly outnumber all the leaves on the Earth\u2019s trees. Chris Mack, a chipmaking expert, working from a previous estimate by VLSI Research, an analysis firm, reckons that perhaps 400 billion billion (4x1020) transistors were churned out in 2015 alone. That works out at about 13 trillion a second. At the same time they have become unimaginably small: millions could fit on the full stop at the end of this sentence.\nA transistor is a sort of switch. To turn it on, a voltage is applied to its gate, which allows the current to flow through the channel between the transistor\u2019s source and drain (see first diagram). When no current flows, the transistor is off. The on-off states represent the 1s and 0s that are the fundamental language of computers.\nThe silicon from which these switches are made is a semiconductor, meaning that its electrical properties are halfway between those of a conductor (in which current can flow easily) and an insulator (in which it cannot). The electrical characteristics of a semiconductor can be tweaked, either by a process called \u201cdoping\u201d, in which the material is spiced with atoms of other elements, such as arsenic or boron, or by the application of an electrical field.\nIn a silicon transistor, the channel will be doped with one material and the source and drain with another. Doping alters the amount of energy required for any charge to flow through a semiconductor, so where two differently doped materials abut each other, current cannot flow. But when the device is switched on, the electric field from the gate generates a thin, conductive bridge within the channel which completes the circuit, allowing current to flow through.\nFor a long time that basic design worked better and better as transistors became ever smaller. But at truly tiny scales it begins to break down. In modern transistors the source and drain are very close together, of the order of 20nm. That causes the channel to leak, with a residual current flowing even when the device is meant to be off, wasting power and generating unwanted heat.\nHeat from this and other sources causes serious problems. Many modern chips must either run below their maximum speeds or even periodically switch parts of themselves off to avoid overheating, which limits their performance.\nChipmakers are trying various methods to avoid this. One of them, called strained silicon, which was introduced by Intel in 2004, involves stretching the atoms of the silicon crystal further apart than normal, which lubricates the passage of charge carriers through the channel, reducing the heat generated.\nIn another technique, first adopted in 2007, metal oxides are used to combat the effects of tunnelling, a quantum phenomenon in which particles (such as electrons) on one side of a seemingly impermeable barrier turn up on the other side without ever passing through the intervening space. Developing more such esoteric techniques may allow chipmakers to go on shrinking transistors for a little longer, but not much.\nThe 3D effect\nBeyond that, two broad changes will be needed. First, the design of the transistor will have to be changed radically. Second, the industry will have to find a replacement for silicon, the electrical properties of which have already been pushed to their limits.\nOne solution to the problem of leaking current is to redesign the channel and the gate. Conventionally, transistors have been flat, but in 2012 Intel added a third dimension to its products. To enable it to build chips with features just 22nm apart, it switched to transistors known as \u201cfinFET\u201d, which feature a channel that sticks up from the surface of the chip. The gate is then wrapped around the channel\u2019s three exposed sides (see second diagram), which gives it much better control over what takes place inside the channel. These new transistors are trickier to make, but they switch 37% faster than old ones of the same size and consume only half as much power.\nThe next logical step, says Mr Snir of Argonne National Laboratory, is \u201cgate-all-around\u201d transistors, in which the channel is surrounded by its gate on all four sides. That offers maximum control, but it adds extra steps to the manufacturing process, since the gate must now be built in multiple sections. Big chipmakers such as Samsung have said that it might take gate-all-around transistors to build chips with features 5nm apart, a stage that Samsung and other makers expect to be reached by the early 2020s.\nBeyond that, more exotic solutions may be needed. One idea is to take advantage of the quantum tunnelling that is such an annoyance for conventional transistors, and that will only get worse as transistors shrink further. It is possible, by applying electrical fields, to control the rate at which tunnelling happens. A low rate of leakage would correspond to a 0; a high rate to a 1. The first experimental tunnelling transistor was demonstrated by a team at IBM in 2004. Since then researchers have been working to commercialise them.\nIn 2015 a team led by Kaustav Banerjee, of the University of California, reported in Nature that they had built a tunnelling transistor with a working voltage of just 0.1, far below the 0.7V of devices now in use, which means much less heat. But there is more work to be done before tunnelling transistors become viable, says Greg Yeric of ARM, a British designer of microchips: for now they do not yet switch on and off quickly enough to allow them to be used for fast chips. Jim Greer and his colleagues at Ireland\u2019s Tyndall Institute are working on another idea. Their device, called a junctionless nanowire transistor (JNT), aims to help with another problem of building at tiny scales: getting the doping right. \u201cThese days you\u2019re talking about [doping] a very small amount of silicon indeed. You\u2019ll soon be at the point where even one or two misplaced dopant atoms could drastically alter the behaviour of your transistor,\u201d says Dr Greer.\nInstead, he and his colleagues propose to build their JNTs, just 3nm across, out of one sort of uniformly doped silicon. Normally that would result in a wire rather than a switch: a device that is uniformly conductive and cannot be turned off. But at these tiny scales the electrical influence of the gate penetrates right through the wire, so the gate alone can prevent current flowing when the transistor is switched off.\nWhereas a conventional transistor works by building an electrical bridge between a source and a drain that are otherwise insulated, Dr Greer\u2019s device works the other way: more like a hose in which the gate acts to stop the current from flowing. \u201cThis is true nanotechnology,\u201d he says. \u201cOur device only works at these sorts of scales. The big advantage is you don\u2019t have to worry about manufacturing these fiddly junctions.\u201d\nMaterial difference\nChipmakers are also experimenting with materials beyond silicon. Last year a research alliance including Samsung, Global Foundries, IBM and State University New York unveiled a microchip made with components 7nm apart, a technology that is not expected to be in consumers\u2019 hands until 2018 at the earliest. It used the same finFET design as the present generation of chips, with slight modifications, but although most of the device was built from the usual silicon, around half of its transistors had channels made from a silicon-germanium (SiGe) alloy.\nThis was chosen because it is, in some ways, a better conductor than silicon. Once again, that means lower power usage and allows the transistor to switch on and off more quickly, boosting the speed of the chip. But it is not a panacea, says Heike Riel, the director of the physical-sciences department at IBM Research. Modern chips are built from two types of transistor. One is designed to conduct electrons, which carry a negative charge. The other sort is designed to conduct \u201choles\u201d, which are places in a semiconductor that might contain electrons but happen not to; these, as it turns out, behave as if they were positively charged electrons. And although SiGe excels at transporting holes, it is rather less good at moving electrons than silicon is.\nFuture paths to higher performance along these lines will probably require both SiGe and another compound that moves electrons even better than silicon. The materials with the most favourable electrical properties are alloys of elements such as indium, gallium and arsenide, collectively known as III-V materials after their location in the periodic table.\nThe trouble is that these materials do not mix easily with silicon. The spacing between the atoms in their crystal lattices is different from that in silicon, so adding a layer of them to the silicon substrate from which all chips are made causes stress that can have the effect of cracking the chip.\nThe best-known alternative is graphene, a single-atom-thick (and hence two-dimensional) form of carbon. Graphene conducts electrons and holes very well. The difficulty is making it stop. Researchers have tried to get around this by doping, squashing or squeezing graphene, or applying electric fields to change its electrical properties. Some progress has been made: the University of Manchester reported a working graphene transistor in 2008; a team led by Guanxiong Liu at the University of California built devices using a property of the material called \u201cnegative resistance\u201d in 2013. But the main impact of graphene, says Dr Yeric, has been to spur interest in other two-dimensional materials. \u201cGraphene sort of unlocked the box,\u201d he says. \u201cNow we\u2019re looking at things like sheets of molybdenum disulphide, or black phosphorous, or phosphorous-boron compounds.\u201d Crucially, all of those, like silicon, can easily be switched on and off.\nIf everything goes according to plan, says Dr Yeric, novel transistor designs and new materials might keep things ticking along for another five or six years, by which time the transistors may be 5nm apart. But beyond that \u201cwe\u2019re running out of ways to stave off the need for something really radical.\u201d\nHis favoured candidate for that is something called \u201cspintronics\u201d. Whereas electronics uses the charge of an electron to represent information, spintronics uses \u201cspin\u201d, another intrinsic property of electrons that is related to the concept of rotational energy an object possesses. Usefully, spin comes in two varieties, up and down, which can be used to represent 1 and 0. And the computing industry has some experience with spintronics already: it is used in hard drives, for instance.\nResearch into spintronic transistors has been going on for more than 15 years, but none has yet made it into production. Appealingly, the voltage needed to drive them is tiny: 10-20 millivolts, hundreds of times lower than for a conventional transistor, which would solve the heat problem at a stroke. But that brings design problems of its own, says Dr Yeric. With such minute voltages, distinguishing a 1 or a 0 from electrical noise becomes tricky.\n\u201cIt\u2019s relatively easy to build a fancy new transistor in the lab,\u201d says Linley Gwennap, the analyst. \u201cBut in order to replace what we\u2019re doing today, you need to be able to put billions on a chip, at a reasonable cost, with high reliability and almost no defects. I hate to say never, but it is very difficult.\u201d That makes it all the more important to pursue other ways of making better computers.",

A few economists, only half-jokingly, hold out the possibility of global incomes becoming infinite. </p>",

                            "text": "A  re we truly so precious?\u201d Dean Baquet, the executive editor of the  New York Times  , asked me one Wednesday evening in June 2020. I was the editorial-page editor of the  Times  , and we had just published an op-ed by  Tom Cotton  , a senator from Arkansas, that was outraging many members of the  Times  staff. America\u2019s conscience had been shocked days before by images of a white police officer kneeling on the neck of a black man, George Floyd, until he died. It was a frenzied time in America, assaulted by covid-19, scalded by police barbarism. Throughout the country  protesters were on the march  . Substantive reform of the police, so long delayed, suddenly seemed like a real possibility, but so did violence and political backlash. In some cities rioting and looting had broken out.\nIt was the kind of crisis in which journalism could fulfil its highest ambitions of helping readers understand the world, in order to fix it, and in the  Times  \u2019s Opinion section, which I oversaw, we were pursuing our role of presenting  debate from all sides  . We had published pieces arguing against the idea of relying on troops to stop the violence, and one urging abolition of the police altogether. But Cotton, an army veteran, was calling for the use of troops to protect lives and businesses from rioters. Some  Times  reporters and other staff were taking to what was then called Twitter, now called X, to attack the decision to publish his argument, for fear he would persuade  Times  readers to support his proposal and it would be enacted. The next day the  Times  \u2019s union\u2014its unit of the NewsGuild-  CWA  \u2014would issue a statement calling the op-ed \u201ca clear threat to the health and safety of the journalists we represent\u201d.\nThe  Times  had endured many cycles of Twitter outrage for one story or opinion piece or another. It was never fun; it felt like sticking your head in a metal bucket while people were banging it with hammers. The publisher, A.G. Sulzberger, who was about two years into the job, understood why we\u2019d published the op-ed. He had some criticisms about packaging; he said the editors should add links to other op-eds we\u2019d published with a different view. But he\u2019d emailed me that afternoon, saying: \u201cI get and support the reason for including the piece,\u201d because, he thought, Cotton\u2019s view had the support of the White House as well as a majority of the Senate. As the clamour grew, he asked me to call Baquet, the paper\u2019s most senior editor.\nLike me, Baquet seemed taken aback by the criticism that  Times  readers shouldn\u2019t hear what Cotton had to say. Cotton had a lot of influence with the White House, Baquet noted, and he could well be making his argument directly to the president, Donald Trump. Readers should know about it. Cotton was also a possible future contender for the White House himself, Baquet added. And, besides, Cotton was far from alone: lots of Americans agreed with him\u2014most of them, according to some polls. \u201cAre we truly so precious?\u201d Baquet asked again, with a note of wonder and frustration.\nThe answer, it turned out, was yes. Less than three days later, on Saturday morning, Sulzberger called me at home and, with an icy anger that still puzzles and saddens me, demanded my resignation. I got mad, too, and said he\u2019d have to fire me. I thought better of that later. I called him back and agreed to resign, flattering myself that I was being noble.\nWhether or not American democracy endures, a central question historians are sure to ask about this era is why America came to elect Donald Trump, promoting him from a symptom of the country\u2019s institutional, political and social degradation to its agent-in-chief. There are many reasons for Trump\u2019s ascent, but changes in the American news media played a critical role. Trump\u2019s manipulation and every one of his political lies became more powerful because journalists had forfeited what had always been most valuable about their work: their credibility as arbiters of truth and brokers of ideas, which for more than a century, despite all of journalism\u2019s flaws and failures, had been a bulwark of how Americans govern themselves.\nI hope those historians will also be able to tell the story of how journalism found its footing again \u2013 how editors, reporters and readers, too, came to recognise that journalism needed to change to fulfil its potential in restoring the health of American politics. As Trump\u2019s nomination and possible re-election loom, that work could not be more urgent.\nI think Sulzberger shares this analysis. In interviews and his own writings, including an essay earlier this year for the  Columbia Journalism Review  , he has defended \u201cindependent journalism\u201d, or, as I understand him, fair-minded, truth-seeking journalism that aspires to be open and objective. It\u2019s good to hear the publisher speak up in defence of such values, some of which have fallen out of fashion not just with journalists at the  Times  and other mainstream publications but at some of the most prestigious schools of journalism. Until that miserable Saturday morning I thought I was standing shoulder-to-shoulder with him in a struggle to revive them. I thought, and still think, that no American institution could have a better chance than the  Times  , by virtue of its principles, its history, its people and its hold on the attention of influential Americans, to lead the resistance to the corruption of political and intellectual life, to overcome the encroaching dogmatism and intolerance.\nBut Sulzberger seems to underestimate the struggle he is in, that all journalism and indeed America itself is in. In describing the essential qualities of independent journalism in his essay, he unspooled a list of admirable traits \u2013 empathy, humility, curiosity and so forth. These qualities have for generations been helpful in contending with the  Times  \u2019s familiar problem, which is liberal bias. I have no doubt Sulzberger believes in them. Years ago he demonstrated them himself as a reporter, covering the American Midwest as a real place full of three-dimensional people, and it would be nice if they were enough to deal with the challenge of this era, too. But, on their own, these qualities have no chance against the  Times  \u2019s new, more dangerous problem, which is in crucial respects the opposite of the old one.\nThe  Times  \u2019s problem has metastasised from liberal bias to illiberal bias, from an inclination to favour one side of the national debate to an impulse to shut debate down altogether. All the empathy and humility in the world will not mean much against the pressures of intolerance and tribalism without an invaluable quality that Sulzberger did not emphasise: courage.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. Most journalism obviously doesn\u2019t require anything like the bravery expected of a soldier, police officer or protester. But far more than when I set out to become a journalist, doing the work right today demands a particular kind of courage: not just the devil-may-care courage to choose a profession on the brink of the abyss; not just the bulldog courage to endlessly pick yourself up and embrace the ever-evolving technology; but also, in an era when polarisation and social media viciously enforce rigid orthodoxies, the moral and intellectual courage to take the other side seriously and to report truths and ideas that your own side demonises for fear they will harm its cause.\nOne of the glories of embracing illiberalism is that, like Trump, you are always right about everything, and so you are justified in shouting disagreement down. In the face of this, leaders of many workplaces and boardrooms across America find that it is so much easier to compromise than to confront \u2013 to give a little ground today in the belief you can ultimately bring people around. This is how reasonable Republican leaders lost control of their party to Trump and how liberal-minded college presidents lost control of their campuses. And it is why the leadership of the  New York Times  is losing control of its principles.\nOver the decades the  Times  and other mainstream news organisations failed plenty of times to live up to their commitments to integrity and open-mindedness. The relentless struggle against biases and preconceptions, rather than the achievement of a superhuman objective omniscience, is what mattered. As everyone knows, the internet knocked the industry off its foundations. Local newspapers were the proving ground between college campuses and national newsrooms. As they disintegrated, the national news media lost a source of seasoned reporters and many Americans lost a journalism whose truth they could verify with their own eyes. As the country became more polarised, the national media followed the money by serving partisan audiences the versions of reality they preferred. This relationship proved self-reinforcing. As Americans became freer to choose among alternative versions of reality, their polarisation intensified. When I was at the  Times  , the newsroom editors worked hardest to keep Washington coverage open and unbiased, no easy task in the Trump era. And there are still people, in the Washington bureau and across the  Times  , doing work as fine as can be found in American journalism. But as the top editors let bias creep into certain areas of coverage, such as culture, lifestyle and business, that made the core harder to defend and undermined the authority of even the best reporters.\nThere have been signs the  Times  is trying to recover the courage of its convictions. The paper was slow to display much curiosity about the hard question of the proper medical protocols for trans children; but once it did, the editors defended their coverage against the inevitable criticism. For any counter-revolution to succeed, the leadership will need to show courage worthy of the paper\u2019s bravest reporters and opinion columnists, the ones who work in war zones or explore ideas that make illiberal staff members shudder. As Sulzberger told me in the past, returning to the old standards will require agonising change. He saw that as the gradual work of many years, but I think he is mistaken. To overcome the cultural and commercial pressures the  Times  faces, particularly given the severe test posed by another Trump candidacy and possible presidency, its publisher and senior editors will have to be bolder than that.\nSince Adolph Ochs bought the paper in 1896, one of the most inspiring things the  Times  has said about itself is that it does its work \u201cwithout fear or favour\u201d. That is not true of the institution today \u2013 it cannot be, not when its journalists are afraid to trust readers with a mainstream conservative argument such as Cotton\u2019s, and its leaders are afraid to say otherwise. As preoccupied as it is with the question of why so many Americans have lost trust in it, the  Times  is failing to face up to one crucial reason: that it has lost faith in Americans, too.\nFor now, to assert that the  Times  plays by the same rules it always has is to commit a hypocrisy that is transparent to conservatives, dangerous to liberals and bad for the country as a whole. It makes the  Times  too easy for conservatives to dismiss and too easy for progressives to believe. The reality is that the  Times  is becoming the publication through which America\u2019s progressive elite talks to itself about an America that does not really exist.\nIt is hard to imagine a path back to saner American politics that does not traverse a common ground of shared fact. It is equally hard to imagine how America\u2019s diversity can continue to be a source of strength, rather than become a fatal flaw, if Americans are afraid or unwilling to listen to each other. I suppose it is also pretty grandiose to think you might help fix all that. But that hope, to me, is what makes journalism worth doing.\nT  he  New York Tim  es taught me how to do daily journalism. I joined the paper, for my first stint, in the pre-internet days, in an era of American journalism so different that it was almost another profession. Back in 1991 the  Times  was anxious not about a print business that was collapsing but about an industry so robust that Long Island  Newsday  was making a push into New York City. A newspaper war was under way, and the  Times  was fighting back by expanding its Metro desk, hiring reporters and opening bureaus in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx.\nMetro was the biggest news desk. New reporters had to do rotations of up to a year there to learn the culture and folkways of the paper. Baquet, surely among the greatest investigative journalists America has produced, was then in Metro. I was brought on as a probationary reporter, with a year to prove myself, and like other new hires was put through a series of assignments at the low end of the hierarchy.\nAfter about six months the Metro editor, Gerald Boyd, asked me to take a walk with him, as it turned out, to deliver a harsh lesson in  Times  ian ambition and discipline. Chain-smoking, speaking in his whispery, peculiarly high-pitched voice, he kicked my ass from one end of Times Square to the other. He had taken a chance hiring me, and he was disappointed. There was nothing special about my stories. At the rate I was going, I had no chance of making it onto the paper.\nThe next day was a Saturday, and I reached Boyd at home through the Metro desk to rattle off the speech I\u2019d endlessly rehearsed while staring at the ceiling all night. The gist was that the desk had kept me chasing small-bore stories, blah blah blah. Boyd sounded less surprised than amused to hear from me, and soon gave me a new assignment, asking me to spend three months covering the elderly, one of several new \u201cmini-beats\u201d on subjects the desk had overlooked.\nI was worried there were good reasons this particular beat had been ignored. At 26, as one of the youngest reporters on the desk, I was also not an obvious candidate for the role of house expert on the wise and grey. But Boyd assigned me to an excellent editor, Suzanne Daley, and as I began studying the city\u2019s elderly and interviewing experts and actual old people, I began to discover the rewards granted any serious reporter: that when you acknowledge how little you know, looking in at a world from the outside brings a special clarity.\nThe subject was more complicated and richer than I imagined, and every person had stories to tell. I wrote about hunger,  AIDS  and romance among the elderly, about old comedians telling old jokes to old people in senior centres. As I reported on Jews who had fled Germany to settle in Washington Heights or black Americans who had left the Jim Crow south to settle in Bushwick, Brooklyn, it dawned on me that, thanks to Boyd, I was covering the history of the world in the 20th century through the eyes of those who had lived it.\nAfter joining the permanent staff, I went, again in humbling ignorance, to Detroit, to cover the auto companies\u2019 \u2013 and the city\u2019s \u2013 struggle to recapture their former glory. And again I had a chance to learn, in this case, everything from how the largest companies in the world were run, to what it was like to work the line or the sales floor, to the struggle and dignity of life in one of America\u2019s most captivating cities. \u201cWe still have a long way to go,\u201d Rosa Parks told me, when I interviewed her after she had been robbed and beaten in her home on Detroit\u2019s west side one August night in 1994. \u201cAnd so many of our children are going astray.\u201d\nI began to write about presidential politics two years later, in 1996, and as the most inexperienced member of the team was assigned to cover a long-shot Republican candidate, Pat Buchanan. I packed a bag for a four-day reporting trip and did not return home for six weeks. Buchanan campaigned on an eccentric fusion of social conservatism and statist economic policies, along with coded appeals to racism and antisemitism, that 30 years earlier had elevated George Wallace and 20 years later would be rebranded as Trumpism. He also campaigned with conviction, humour and even joy, a combination I have rarely witnessed. As a Democrat from a family of Democrats, a graduate of Yale and a blossom of the imagined meritocracy, I had my first real chance, at Buchanan\u2019s rallies, to see the world through the eyes of stalwart opponents of abortion, immigration and the relentlessly rising tide of modernity.\nThe task of making the world intelligible was even greater in my first foreign assignment. I arrived in Jerusalem a week before the attacks of September 11th 2001, just after the second intifada had broken out. I had been to the Middle East just once, as a White House reporter covering President Bill Clinton. \u201cWell, in at the deep end,\u201d the foreign editor, Roger Cohen, told me before I left. To spend time with the perpetrators and victims of violence in the Middle East, to listen hard to the reciprocal and reinforcing stories of new and ancient grievances, is to confront the tragic truth that there can be justice on more than one side of a conflict. More than ever, it seemed to me that a reporter gave up something in renouncing the taking of sides: possibly the moral high ground, certainly the psychological satisfaction of righteous anger.\nBut there was a compensating moral and psychological privilege that came with aspiring to journalistic neutrality and open-mindedness, despised as they might understandably be by partisans. Unlike the duelling politicians and advocates of all kinds, unlike the corporate chieftains and their critics, unlike even the sainted non-profit workers, you did not have to pretend things were simpler than they actually were. You did not have to go along with everything that any tribe said. You did not have to pretend that the good guys, much as you might have respected them, were right about everything, or that the bad guys, much as you might have disdained them, never had a point. You did not, in other words, ever have to lie.\nThis fundamental honesty was vital for readers, because it equipped them to make better, more informed judgments about the world. Sometimes it might shock or upset them by failing to conform to their picture of reality. But it also granted them the respect of acknowledging that they were able to work things out for themselves.\nWhat a gift it was to be taught and trusted as I was by my editors \u2013 to be a reporter with licence to ask anyone anything, to experience the whole world as a school and every source and subject as a teacher. I left after 15 years, in 2006, when I had the chance to become editor of the  Atlantic  . Rather than starting out on yet another beat at the  Times  , I felt ready to put my experience to work and ambitious for the responsibility to shape coverage myself. It was also obvious how much the internet was changing journalism. I was eager to figure out how to use it, and anxious about being at the mercy of choices by others, in a time not just of existential peril for the industry, but maybe of opportunity.\nThe  Atlantic  did not aspire to the same role as the  Times  . It did not promise to serve up the news of the day without any bias. But it was to opinion journalism what the  Times  \u2019s reporting was supposed to be to news: honest and open to the world. The question was what the magazine\u2019s 19th-century claim of intellectual independence \u2013 to be \u201cof no party or clique\u201d \u2013 should mean in the digital era.\nThose were the glory days of the blog, and we hit on the idea of creating a living op-ed page, a collective of bloggers with different points of view but a shared intellectual honesty who would argue out the meaning of the news of the day. They were brilliant, gutsy writers, and their disagreements were deep enough that I used to joke that my main work as editor was to prevent fistfights.\nThe lessons we learned from adapting the  Atlantic  to the internet washed back into print. Under its owner, David Bradley, my colleagues and I distilled our purpose as publishing big arguments about big ideas. We made some mistakes \u2013 that goes along with any serious journalism ambitious to make a change, and to embrace change itself \u2013 but we also began producing some of the most important work in American journalism: Nicholas Carr on whether Google was \u201cmaking us stupid\u201d; Hanna Rosin on \u201cthe end of men\u201d; Taylor Branch on \u201cthe shame of college sports\u201d; Ta-Nehisi Coates on \u201cthe case for reparations\u201d; Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt on \u201cthe coddling of the American mind\u201d.\nI was starting to see some effects of the new campus politics within the  Atlantic  . A promising new editor had created a digital form for aspiring freelancers to fill out, and she wanted to ask them to disclose their racial and sexual identity. Why? Because, she said, if we were to write about the trans community, for example, we would ask a trans person to write the story. There was a good argument for that, I acknowledged, and it sometimes might be the right answer. But as I thought about the old people, auto workers and abortion opponents I had learned from, I told her there was also an argument for correspondents who brought an outsider\u2019s ignorance, along with curiosity and empathy, to the story.\nA journalism that starts out assuming it knows the answers, it seemed to me then, and seems even more so to me now, can be far less valuable to the reader than a journalism that starts out with a humbling awareness that it knows nothing. \u201cIn truly effective thinking\u201d, Walter Lippmann wrote 100 years ago in \u201cPublic Opinion\u201d, \u201cthe prime necessity is to liquidate judgments, regain an innocent eye, disentangle feelings, be curious and open-hearted.\u201d Alarmed by the shoddy journalism of his day, Lippmann was calling for journalists to struggle against their ignorance and assumptions in order to help Americans resist the increasingly sophisticated tools of propagandists. As the  Atlantic  made its digital transition, one thing I preached was that we could not cling to any tradition or convention, however hallowed, for its own sake, but only if it was relevant to the needs of readers today. In the age of the internet it is hard even for a child to sustain an \u201cinnocent eye\u201d, but the alternative for journalists remains as dangerous as ever, to become propagandists. America has more than enough of those already.\nWhat we did together at the  Atlantic  worked. We dramatically increased the magazine\u2019s audience and influence while making it profitable for the first time in generations. After I had spent ten years as editor, the last few as co-president, the publisher, A.G. Sulzberger\u2019s father, also an Arthur Sulzberger, asked me to return to the  Times  as editorial-page editor.\nHis offer, I thought, would give me the chance to do the kind of journalism I loved with more resources and greater effect. The freedom Opinion had to experiment with voice and point of view meant that it would be more able than the  Times  newsroom to take advantage of the tools of digital journalism, from audio to video to graphics. Opinion writers could also break out of limiting print conventions and do more in-depth, reported columns and editorials. Though the Opinion department, which then had about 100 staff, was a fraction the size of the newsroom, with more than 1,300, Opinion\u2019s work had outsized reach. Most important, the  Times  , probably more than any other American institution, could influence the way society approached debate and engagement with opposing views. If  Times  Opinion demonstrated the same kind of intellectual courage and curiosity that my colleagues at the  Atlantic  had shown, I hoped, the rest of the media would follow.\nNo doubt Sulzberger\u2019s offer also appealed not just to my loyalty to the  Times  , but to my ambition as well. I would report directly to the publisher, and I was immediately seen, inside and outside the paper, as a candidate for the top job. I had hoped being in Opinion would exempt me from the infamous political games of the newsroom, but it did not, and no doubt my old colleagues felt I was playing such games myself. Fairly quickly, though, I realised two things: first, that if I did my job as I thought it should be done, and as the Sulzbergers said they wanted me to do it, I would be too polarising internally ever to lead the newsroom; second, that I did not want that job, though no one but my wife believed me when I said that.\nIt was 2016, a presidential-election year, and I had been gone from the  Times  for a decade. Although many of my old colleagues had also left in the interim and the  Times  had moved into a new glass-and-steel tower, I otherwise had little idea how much things had changed. When I looked around the Opinion department, change was not what I perceived. Excellent writers and editors were doing excellent work. But the department\u2019s journalism was consumed with politics and foreign affairs in an era when readers were also fascinated by changes in technology, business, science and culture.\nThe Opinion department mocked the paper\u2019s claim to value diversity. It did not have a single black editor. The large staff of op-ed editors contained only a couple of women. Although the 11 columnists were individually admirable, only two of them were women and only one was a person of colour. (The  Times  had not appointed a black columnist until the 1990s, and had only employed two in total.) Not only did they all focus on politics and foreign affairs, but during the 2016 campaign, no columnist shared, in broad terms, the worldview of the ascendant progressives of the Democratic Party, incarnated by Bernie Sanders. And only two were conservative.\nThis last fact was of particular concern to the elder Sulzberger. He told me the  Times  needed more conservative voices, and that its own editorial line had become predictably left-wing. \u201cToo many liberals,\u201d read my notes about the Opinion line-up from a meeting I had with him and Mark Thompson, then the chief executive, as I was preparing to rejoin the paper. \u201cEven conservatives are liberals\u2019 idea of a conservative.\u201d The last note I took from that meeting was: \u201cCan\u2019t ignore 150m conservative Americans.\u201d\nWith my Opinion colleagues, I set out to deal with this long list of needs. I restructured the department, changing everybody\u2019s role and, using buyouts, changing people as well. It was too much, too fast; it rocked the department, and my colleagues and I made mistakes amid the turmoil, including one that brought a libel suit from John McCain\u2019s vice-presidential running-mate, Sarah Palin, dismissed twice by a judge and once by a jury but endlessly appealed on procedural grounds. Yet we also did more in four years to diversify the line-up of writers by identity, ideology and expertise than the  Times  had in the previous century; we published more ambitious projects than Opinion had ever attempted. We won two Pulitzer prizes in four years \u2013 as many as the department had in the previous 20.\nAs I knew from my time at the  Atlantic,  this kind of structural transformation can be frightening and even infuriating for those understandably proud of things as they are. It is hard on everyone. But experience at the  Atlantic  also taught me that pursuing new ways of doing journalism in pursuit of venerable institutional principles created enthusiasm for change. I expected that same dynamic to allay concerns at the  Times  .\nIn that same statement in 1896, after committing the  Times  to pursue the news without fear or favour, Ochs promised to \u201cinvite intelligent discussion from all shades of opinion\u201d. So adding new voices, some more progressive and others more conservative, and more journalists of diverse identities and backgrounds, fulfilled the paper\u2019s historic purpose. If Opinion published a wider range of views, it would help frame a set of shared arguments that corresponded to, and drew upon, the set of shared facts coming from the newsroom. On the right and left, America\u2019s elites now talk within their tribes, and get angry or contemptuous on those occasions when they happen to overhear the other conclave. If they could be coaxed to agree what they were arguing about, and the rules by which they would argue about it, opinion journalism could serve a foundational need of the democracy by fostering diverse and inclusive debate. Who could be against that?\nOut of naivety or arrogance, I was slow to recognise that at the  Times  , unlike at the  Atlantic  , these values were no longer universally accepted, let alone esteemed. When I first took the job, I felt some days as if I\u2019d parachuted onto one of those Pacific islands still held by Japanese soldiers who didn\u2019t know that the world beyond the waves had changed. Eventually, it sank in that my snotty joke was actually on me: I was the one ignorantly fighting a battle that was already lost. The old liberal embrace of inclusive debate that reflected the country\u2019s breadth of views had given way to a new intolerance for the opinions of roughly half of American voters. New progressive voices were celebrated within the  Times  . But in contrast to the  Wall Street Journal  and the  Washington Post,  conservative voices \u2013 even eloquent anti-Trump conservative voices \u2013 were despised, regardless of how many leftists might surround them. (President Trump himself submitted one op-ed during my time, but we could not raise it to our standards \u2013 his people would not agree to the edits we asked for.)\nAbout a year after the 2016 election, the  Times  newsroom published a profile of a man from Ohio who had attended the rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, at which a white nationalist drove his car into a crowd of protesters, killing one. It was a terrifying piece. The man had four cats, listened to National Public Radio, and had registered at Target for a muffin pan before his recent wedding. In exploring his evolution from \u201cvaguely leftist rock musician to ardent libertarian to fascist activist\u201d the article rang an alarm about how \u201cthe election of President Donald Trump helped open a space for people like him\u201d.\nThe profile was in keeping with the  Times  \u2019s tradition of confronting readers with the confounding reality of the world around them. After the 9/11 attacks, as the bureau chief in Jerusalem, I spent a lot of time in the Gaza Strip interviewing Hamas leaders, recruiters and foot soldiers, trying to understand and describe their murderous ideology. Some readers complained that I was providing a platform for terrorists, but there was never any objection from within the  Times  . (Nor did it occur to me to complain that by publishing op-eds critical of Hamas the Opinion department was putting my life in danger.) Our role, we knew, was to help readers understand such threats, and this required empathetic \u2013 not sympathetic \u2013 reporting. This is not an easy distinction but good reporters make it: they learn to understand and communicate the sources and nature of a toxic ideology without justifying it, much less advocating it.\nToday\u2019s newsroom turns that moral logic on its head, at least when it comes to fellow Americans. Unlike the views of Hamas, the views of many Americans have come to seem dangerous to engage in the absence of explicit condemnation. Focusing on potential perpetrators \u2013 \u201cplatforming\u201d them by explaining rather than judging their views \u2013 is believed to empower them to do more harm. After the profile of the Ohio man was published, media Twitter lit up with attacks on the article as \u201cnormalising\u201d Nazism and white nationalism, and the  Times  convulsed internally. The  Times  wound up publishing a cringing editor\u2019s note that hung the writer out to dry and approvingly quoted some of the criticism, including a tweet from a  Washington Post  opinion editor asking, \u201cInstead of long, glowing profiles of Nazis/White nationalists, why don\u2019t we profile the victims of their ideologies\u201d? The  Times  did profile the victims of such ideologies; and the very headline of the piece \u2013 \u201cA Voice of Hate in America\u2019s Heartland\u201d \u2013 undermined the claim that it was \u201cglowing\u201d. But the  Times  lacked the confidence to defend its own work. (As it happens, being platformed did not do much to increase the power of that Ohio man. He, his wife and his brother lost their jobs and the newly married couple lost the home intended for their muffin pan.)\nThe editor\u2019s note paraded the principle of publishing such pieces, saying it was important to \u201cshed more light, not less, on the most extreme corners of American life\u201d. But less light is what the readers got. As a reporter in the newsroom, you\u2019d have to have been an idiot after that explosion to attempt such a profile. Empathetic reporting about Trump supporters became even more rare. It became a clich\u00e9 among influential left-wing columnists and editors that blinkered political reporters interviewed a few Trump supporters in diners and came away suckered into thinking there was something besides racism that could explain anyone\u2019s support for the man.\nI failed to take the hint. As the first anniversary of Trump\u2019s inauguration approached, the editors who compile letters to the  Times  , part of my department, had put out a request to readers who supported the president to say what they thought of him now. The results had some nuance. \u201cYes, he is embarrassing,\u201d wrote one reader. \u201cYes, he picks unnecessary fights. But he also pushed tax reform through, has largely defeated  ISIS  in Iraq,\u201d and so forth. After a year spent publishing editorials attacking Trump and his policies, I thought it would be a demonstration of  Times  ian open-mindedness to give his supporters their say. Also, I thought the letters were interesting, so I turned over the entire editorial page to the Trump letters.\nI wasn\u2019t surprised that we got some criticism on Twitter. But I was astonished by the fury of my  Times  colleagues. I found myself facing an angry internal town hall, trying to justify what to me was an obvious journalistic decision. During the session, one of the newsroom\u2019s journalists demanded to know when I would publish a page of letters from Barack Obama\u2019s supporters. I stammered out some kind of answer. The question just didn\u2019t make sense to me. Pretty much every day we published letters from people who supported Obama and criticised Trump. Didn\u2019t he know that Obama wasn\u2019t president any more? Didn\u2019t he think other  Times  readers should understand the sources of Trump\u2019s support? Didn\u2019t he also see it was a wonderful thing that some Trump supporters did not just dismiss the  Times  as fake news, but still believed in it enough to respond thoughtfully to an invitation to share their views?\nAnd if the  Times  could not bear to publish the views of Americans who supported Trump, why should it be surprised that those voters would not trust it? Two years later, in 2020, Baquet acknowledged that in 2016 the  Times  had failed to take seriously the idea that Trump could become president partly because it failed to send its reporters out into America to listen to voters and understand \u201cthe turmoil in the country\u201d. And, he continued, the  Times  still did not understand the views of many Americans. \u201cOne of the great puzzles of 2016 remains a great puzzle,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy did millions and millions of Americans vote for a guy who\u2019s such an unusual candidate?\u201d Speaking four months before we published the Cotton op-ed, he said that to argue that the views of such voters should not appear in the  Times  was \u201cnot journalistic\u201d.\nConservative arguments in the Opinion pages reliably started uproars within the  Times  . Sometimes I would hear directly from colleagues who had the grace to confront me with their concerns; more often they would take to the company\u2019s Slack channels or Twitter to advertise their distress in front of each other. By contrast, in my four years as Opinion editor, I received just two complaints from newsroom staff about pieces we published from the left. When I was visiting one of the  Times  \u2019s West Coast bureaus, a reporter pulled me aside to say he worried that a liberal columnist was engaged in ad hominem attacks; a reporter in the Washington bureau wrote to me to object to an op-ed piece questioning the value of protecting free speech for right-wing groups.\nThis environment of enforced group-think, inside and outside the paper, was hard even on liberal opinion writers. One left-of-centre columnist told me that he was reluctant to appear in the New York office for fear of being accosted by colleagues. (An internal survey shortly after I left the paper found that barely half the staff, within an enterprise ostensibly devoted to telling the truth, agreed \u201cthere is a free exchange of views in this company\u201d and \u201cpeople are not afraid to say what they really think\u201d.) Even columnists with impeccable leftist bona fides recoiled from tackling subjects when their point of view might depart from progressive orthodoxy. I once complimented a long-time, left-leaning Opinion writer over a column criticising Democrats in Congress for doing something stupid. Trying to encourage more such journalism and thus less such stupidity, I remarked that this kind of argument had more influence than yet another Trump-is-a-devil column. \u201cI know,\u201d he replied, ruefully. \u201cBut Twitter hates it.\u201d\nThe bias had become so pervasive, even in the senior editing ranks of the newsroom, as to be unconscious. Trying to be helpful, one of the top newsroom editors urged me to start attaching trigger warnings to pieces by conservatives. It had not occurred to him how this would stigmatise certain colleagues, or what it would say to the world about the  Times  \u2019s own bias. By their nature, information bubbles are powerfully self-reinforcing, and I think many  Times  staff have little idea how closed their world has become, or how far they are from fulfilling their compact with readers to show the world \u201cwithout fear or favour\u201d. And sometimes the bias was explicit: one newsroom editor told me that, because I was publishing more conservatives, he felt he needed to push his own department further to the left.\nThe  Times  \u2019s failure to honour its own stated principles of openness to a range of views was particularly hard on the handful of conservative writers, some of whom would complain about being flyspecked and abused by colleagues. One day when I relayed a conservative\u2019s concern about double standards to Sulzberger, he lost his patience. He told me to inform the complaining conservative that that\u2019s just how it was: there was a double standard and he should get used to it. A publication that promises its readers to stand apart from politics should not have different standards for different writers based on their politics. But I delivered the message. There are many things I regret about my tenure as editorial-page editor. That is the only act of which I am ashamed.\nA  s I realised how different the new  Times  had become from the old one that trained me, I began to think of myself not as a benighted veteran on a remote island, but as Rip Van Winkle. I had left one newspaper, had a pleasant dream for ten years, and returned to a place I barely recognised. The new  New York Times  was the product of two shocks \u2013 sudden collapse, and then sudden success. The paper almost went bankrupt during the financial crisis, and the ensuing panic provoked a crisis of confidence among its leaders. Digital competitors like the  HuffPost  were gaining readers and winning plaudits within the media industry as innovative. They were the cool kids;  Times  folk were ink-stained wrinklies.\nIn its panic, the  Times  bought out experienced reporters and editors and began hiring journalists from publications like the  HuffPost  who were considered \u201cdigital natives\u201d because they had never worked in print. This hiring quickly became easier, since most digital publications financed by venture capital turned out to be bad businesses. The advertising that was supposed to fund them flowed instead to the giant social-media companies. The  HuffPost  s and  Buzzfeed  s began to decay, and the  Times  \u2019s subscriptions and staff began to grow.\nI have been lucky in my own career to move between local and national and international journalism, newspapers and magazines, opinion and news, and the print and digital realms. I was even luckier in these various roles to have editors with a profound understanding of their particular form and a sense of duty about teaching it. The wipeout of local papers and the desperate transformation of survivors like the  Times  have left young reporters today with fewer such opportunities.\nThough they might have lacked deep or varied reporting backgrounds, some of the  Times  \u2019s new hires brought skills in video and audio; others were practised at marketing themselves \u2013 building their brands, as journalists now put it \u2013 in social media. Some were brilliant and fiercely honest, in keeping with the old aspirations of the paper. But, critically, the  Times  abandoned its practice of acculturation, including those months-long assignments on Metro covering cops and crime or housing. Many new hires who never spent time in the streets went straight into senior writing and editing roles. Meanwhile, the paper began pushing out its print-era salespeople and hiring new ones, and also hiring hundreds of engineers to build its digital infrastructure. All these recruits arrived with their own notions of the purpose of the  Times  . To me, publishing conservatives helped fulfil the paper\u2019s mission; to them, I think, it betrayed that mission.\nAnd then, to the shock and horror of the newsroom, Trump won the presidency. In his article for  Columbia Journalism Review  , Sulzberger cites the  Times  \u2019s failure to take Trump\u2019s chances seriously as an example of how \u201cprematurely shutting down inquiry and debate\u201d can allow \u201cconventional wisdom to ossify in a way that blinds society.\u201d Many  Times  staff members \u2013 scared, angry \u2013 assumed the  Times  was supposed to help lead the resistance. Anxious for growth, the  Times  \u2019s marketing team implicitly endorsed that idea, too.\nAs the number of subscribers ballooned, the marketing department tracked their expectations, and came to a nuanced conclusion. More than 95% of  Times  subscribers described themselves as Democrats or independents, and a vast majority of them believed the  Times  was also liberal. A similar majority applauded that bias; it had become \u201ca selling point\u201d, reported one internal marketing memo. Yet at the same time, the marketers concluded, subscribers wanted to believe that the  Times  was independent.\nWhen you think about it, this contradiction resolves itself easily. It is human nature to want to see your bias confirmed; however, it is also human nature to want to be reassured that your bias is not just a bias, but is endorsed by journalism that is \u201cfair and balanced\u201d, as a certain Murdoch-owned cable-news network used to put it. As that memo argued, even if the  Times  was seen as politically to the left, it was critical to its brand also to be seen as broadening its readers\u2019 horizons, and that required \u201ca perception of independence\u201d.\nPerception is one thing, and actual independence another. Readers could cancel their subscriptions if the  Times  challenged their worldview by reporting the truth without regard to politics. As a result, the  Times  \u2019s long-term civic value was coming into conflict with the paper\u2019s short-term shareholder value. As the cable networks have shown, you can build a decent business by appealing to the millions of Americans who comprise one of the partisan tribes of the electorate. The  Times  has every right to pursue the commercial strategy that makes it the most money. But leaning into a partisan audience creates a powerful dynamic. Nobody warned the new subscribers to the  Times  that it might disappoint them by reporting truths that conflicted with their expectations. When your product is \u201cindependent journalism\u201d, that commercial strategy is tricky, because too much independence might alienate your audience, while too little can lead to charges of hypocrisy that strike at the heart of the brand.\nIt became one of Dean Baquet\u2019s frequent mordant jokes that he missed the old advertising-based business model, because, compared with subscribers, advertisers felt so much less sense of ownership over the journalism. I recall his astonishment, fairly early in the Trump administration, after  Times  reporters conducted an interview with Trump. Subscribers were angry about the questions the  Times  had asked. It was as if they\u2019d only be satisfied, Baquet said, if the reporters leaped across the desk and tried to wring the president\u2019s neck. The  Times  was slow to break it to its readers that there was less to Trump\u2019s ties to Russia than they were hoping, and more to Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop, that Trump might be right that covid came from a Chinese lab, that masks were not always effective against the virus, that shutting down schools for many months was a bad idea.\nIn my experience, reporters overwhelmingly support Democratic policies and candidates. They are generally also motivated by a desire for a more just world. Neither of those tendencies are new. But there has been a sea change over the past ten years in how journalists think about pursuing justice. The reporters\u2019 creed used to have its foundation in liberalism, in the classic philosophical sense. The exercise of a reporter\u2019s curiosity and empathy, given scope by the constitutional protections of free speech, would equip readers with the best information to form their own judgments. The best ideas and arguments would win out. The journalist\u2019s role was to be a sworn witness; the readers\u2019 role was to be judge and jury. In its idealised form, journalism was lonely, prickly, unpopular work, because it was only through unrelenting scepticism and questioning that society could advance. If everyone the reporter knew thought X, the reporter\u2019s role was to ask: why X?\nIlliberal journalists have a different philosophy, and they have their reasons for it. They are more concerned with group rights than individual rights, which they regard as a bulwark for the privileges of white men. They have seen the principle of free speech used to protect right-wing outfits like  Project Veritas  and  Breitbart News  and are uneasy with it. They had their suspicions of their fellow citizens\u2019 judgment confirmed by Trump\u2019s election, and do not believe readers can be trusted with potentially dangerous ideas or facts. They are not out to achieve social justice as the knock-on effect of pursuing truth; they want to pursue it head-on. The term \u201cobjectivity\u201d to them is code for ignoring the poor and weak and cosying up to power, as journalists often have done.\nAnd they do not just want to be part of the cool crowd. They need to be. To be more valued by their peers and their contacts \u2013 and hold sway over their bosses \u2013 they need a lot of followers in social media. That means they must be seen to applaud the right sentiments of the right people in social media. The journalist from central casting used to be a loner, contrarian or a misfit. Now journalism is becoming another job for joiners, or, to borrow Twitter\u2019s own parlance, \u201cfollowers\u201d, a term that mocks the essence of a journalist\u2019s role.\nThis is a bit of a paradox. The new newsroom ideology seems idealistic, yet it has grown from cynical roots in academia: from the idea that there is no such thing as objective truth; that there is only narrative, and that therefore whoever controls the narrative \u2013 whoever gets to tell the version of the story that the public hears \u2013 has the whip hand. What matters, in other words, is not truth and ideas in themselves, but the power to determine both in the public mind.\nBy contrast, the old newsroom ideology seems cynical on its surface. It used to bug me that my editors at the  Times  assumed every word out of the mouth of any person in power was a lie. And the pursuit of objectivity can seem reptilian, even nihilistic, in its abjuration of a fixed position in moral contests. But the basis of that old newsroom approach was idealistic: the notion that power ultimately lies in truth and ideas, and that the citizens of a pluralistic democracy, not leaders of any sort, must be trusted to judge both.\nOur role in  Times  Opinion, I used to urge my colleagues, was not to tell people what to think, but to help them fulfil their desire to think for themselves. It seems to me that putting the pursuit of truth, rather than of justice, at the top of a publication\u2019s hierarchy of values also better serves not just truth but justice, too: over the long term journalism that is not also sceptical of the advocates of any form of justice and the programmes they put forward, and that does not struggle honestly to understand and explain the sources of resistance, will not assure that those programmes will work, and it also has no legitimate claim to the trust of reasonable people who see the world very differently. Rather than advance understanding and durable change, it provokes backlash.\nThe impatience within the newsroom with such old ways was intensified by the generational failure of the  Times  to hire and promote women and non-white people, black people in particular. In the 1990s, and into the early part of this century, when I worked in the high-profile Washington bureau of the  Times  , usually at most two of the dozens of journalists stationed there were black. Before Baquet became executive editor, the highest-ranked black journalist at the  Times  had been my old Metro editor, Gerald Boyd. He rose to become managing editor before A.G. Sulzberger\u2019s father pushed him out, along with the executive editor, Howell Raines, when a black reporter named Jayson Blair was discovered to be a fabulist. Boyd was said to have protected Blair, an accusation he denied and attributed to racism.\nThe accusation against Boyd never made sense to me. In my experience he was even harder on black and brown reporters than he was on us white people. He understood better than anyone what it would take for them to succeed at the  Times  . \u201cThe  Times  was a place where blacks felt they had to convince their white peers that they were good enough to be there,\u201d he wrote in his heartbreaking memoir, published posthumously. He died in 2006 of lung cancer, three years after he was discarded.\nPay attention if you are white at the  Times  and you will hear black editors speak of hiring consultants at their own expense to figure out how to get white staff to respect them. You might hear how a black journalist, passing through the newsroom, was asked by a white colleague whether he was the \u201ctelephone guy\u201d sent to fix his extension. I certainly never got asked a question like that. Among the experienced journalists at the  Times  , black journalists were least likely, I thought, to exhibit fragility and herd behaviour.\nAs wave after wave of pain and outrage swept through the  Times  , over a headline that was not damning enough of Trump or someone\u2019s obnoxious tweets, I came to think of the people who were fragile, the ones who were caught up in Slack or Twitter storms, as people who had only recently discovered that they were white and were still getting over the shock. Having concluded they had got ahead by working hard, it has been a revelation to them that their skin colour was not just part of the wallpaper of American life, but a source of power, protection and advancement. They may know a lot about television, or real estate, or how to edit audio files, but their work does not take them into shelters, or police precincts, or the homes of people who see the world very differently. It has never exposed them to live fire. Their idea of violence includes vocabulary.\nI share the bewilderment that so many people could back Trump, given the things he says and does, and that makes me want to understand why they do: the breadth and diversity of his support suggests not just racism is at work. Yet these elite, well-meaning  Times  staff cannot seem to stretch the empathy they are learning to extend to people with a different skin colour to include those, of whatever race, who have different politics.\nThe digital natives were nevertheless valuable, not only for their skills but also because they were excited for the  Times  to embrace its future. That made them important allies of the editorial and business leaders as they sought to shift the  Times  to digital journalism and to replace staff steeped in the ways of print. Partly for that reason, and partly out of fear, the leadership indulged internal attacks on  Times  journalism, despite pleas from me and others, to them and the company as a whole, that  Times  folk should treat each other with more respect. My colleagues and I in Opinion came in for a lot of the scorn, but we were not alone. Correspondents in the Washington bureau and political reporters would take a beating, too, when they were seen as committing sins like \u201cfalse balance\u201d because of the nuance in their stories.\nMy fellow editorial and commercial leaders were well aware of how the culture of the institution had changed. As delighted as they were by the  Times  \u2019s digital transformation they were not blind to the ideological change that came with it. They were unhappy with the bullying and group-think; we often discussed such cultural problems in the weekly meetings of the executive committee, composed of the top editorial and business leaders, including the publisher. Inevitably, these bitch sessions would end with someone saying a version of: \u201cWell, at some point we have to tell them this is what we believe in as a newspaper, and if they don\u2019t like it they should work somewhere else.\u201d It took me a couple of years to realise that this moment was never going to come.\nMore than 30 years ago, a young political reporter named Todd Purdum tremulously asked an all-staff meeting what would be done about the \u201cclimate of fear\u201d within the newsroom in which reporters felt intimidated by their bosses? The moment immediately entered  Times  lore. There is a lot not to miss about the days when editors like Boyd could strike terror in young reporters like me and Purdum. But the pendulum has swung so far in the other direction that editors now tremble before their reporters and even their interns. \u201cI miss the old climate of fear,\u201d Baquet used to say with a smile, in another of his barbed jokes.\nD  uring the first meeting of the  Times  board of directors that I attended, in 2016, Baquet and I hosted a joint question-and-answer session. At one point, Baquet, musing about how the  Times  was changing, observed that one of the newsroom\u2019s cultural critics had become the paper\u2019s best political-opinion columnist. Taking this musing one step further, I then noted that this raised an obvious question: why did the paper still have an Opinion department separate from the newsroom, with its own editor reporting directly to the publisher? If the newsroom was publishing the best opinion journalism at the paper \u2013 if it was publishing opinion at all \u2013 why did the  Times  maintain a separate department that falsely claimed to have a monopoly on such journalism?\nEveryone laughed. But I meant it, and I wish I\u2019d pursued my point and talked myself out of the job. This contest over control of opinion journalism within the  Times  was not just a bureaucratic turf battle (though it was that, too). The newsroom\u2019s embrace of opinion journalism has compromised the  Times  \u2019s independence, misled its readers and fostered a culture of intolerance and conformity.\nThe Opinion department is a relic of the era when the  Times  enforced a line between news and opinion journalism. Editors in the newsroom did not touch opinionated copy, lest they be contaminated by it, and opinion journalists and editors kept largely to their own, distant floor within the  Times  building. Such fastidiousness could seem excessive, but it enforced an ethos that  Times  reporters owed their readers an unceasing struggle against bias in the news. But by the time I returned as editorial-page editor, more opinion columnists and critics were writing for the newsroom than for Opinion. As at the cable news networks, the boundaries between commentary and news were disappearing, and readers had little reason to trust that  Times  journalists were resisting rather than indulging their biases.\nThe  Times  newsroom had added more cultural critics, and, as Baquet noted, they were free to opine about politics. Departments across the  Times  newsroom had also begun appointing their own \u201ccolumnists\u201d, without stipulating any rules that might distinguish them from columnists in Opinion. It became a running joke. Every few months, some poor editor in the newsroom or Opinion would be tasked with writing up guidelines that would distinguish the newsroom\u2019s opinion journalists from those of Opinion, and every time they would ultimately throw up their hands.\nI remember how shaken A.G. Sulzberger was one day when he was cornered by a cultural critic who had got wind that such guardrails might be put in place. The critic insisted he was an opinion writer, just like anyone in the Opinion department, and he would not be reined in. He wasn\u2019t. (I checked to see if, since I left the  Times  , it had developed guidelines explaining the difference, if any, between a news columnist and opinion columnist. The paper\u2019s spokeswoman, Danielle Rhoades Ha, did not respond to the question.)\nThe internet rewards opinionated work and, as news editors felt increasing pressure to generate page views, they began not just hiring more opinion writers but also running their own versions of opinionated essays by outside voices \u2013 historically, the province of Opinion\u2019s op-ed department. Yet because the paper continued to honour the letter of its old principles, none of this work could be labelled \u201copinion\u201d (it still isn\u2019t). After all, it did not come from the Opinion department. And so a newsroom technology columnist might call for, say, unionisation of the Silicon Valley workforce, as one did, or an outside writer might argue in the business section for reparations for slavery, as one did, and to the average reader their work would appear indistinguishable from  Times  news articles.\nBy similarly circular logic, the newsroom\u2019s opinion journalism breaks another of the  Times  \u2019s commitments to its readers. Because the newsroom officially does not do opinion \u2013 even though it openly hires and publishes opinion journalists \u2013 it feels free to ignore Opinion\u2019s mandate to provide a diversity of views. When I was editorial-page editor, there were a couple of newsroom columnists whose politics were not obvious. But the other newsroom columnists, and the critics, read as passionate progressives.\nI urged Baquet several times to add a conservative to the newsroom roster of cultural critics. That would serve the readers by diversifying the  Times  \u2019s analysis of culture, where the paper\u2019s left-wing bias had become most blatant, and it would show that the newsroom also believed in restoring the  Times  \u2019s commitment to taking conservatives seriously. He said this was a good idea, but he never acted on it. I couldn\u2019t help trying the idea out on one of the paper\u2019s top cultural editors, too: he told me he did not think  Times  readers would be interested in that point of view.\nAs the  Times  tried to compete for more readers online, homogenous opinion was spreading through the newsroom in other ways. News desks were urging reporters to write in the first person and to use more \u201cvoice\u201d, but few newsroom editors had experience in handling that kind of journalism, and no one seemed certain where \u201cvoice\u201d stopped and \u201copinion\u201d began. The  Times  magazine, meanwhile, became a crusading progressive publication. Baquet liked to say the magazine was Switzerland, by which he meant that it sat between the newsroom and Opinion. But it reported only to the news side. Its work was not labelled as opinion and it was free to omit conservative viewpoints.\nThis creep of politics into the newsroom\u2019s journalism helped the  Times  beat back some of its new challengers, at least those on the left. Competitors like  Vox  and the  HuffPost  were blending leftish politics with reporting and writing it up conversationally in the first person. Imitating their approach, along with hiring some of their staff, helped the  Times  repel them. But it came at a cost. The rise of opinion journalism over the past 15 years changed the newsroom\u2019s coverage and its culture. The tiny redoubt of never-Trump conservatives in Opinion is swamped daily not only by the many progressives in that department but their reinforcements among the critics, columnists and magazine writers in the newsroom. They are generally excellent, but their homogeneity means  Times  readers are being served a very restricted range of views, some of them presented as straight news by a publication that still holds itself out as independent of any politics. And because the critics, newsroom columnists and magazine writers are the newsroom\u2019s most celebrated journalists, they have disproportionate influence over the paper\u2019s culture.\nAnd yet the  Times  insists to the public that nothing has changed. By saying that it still holds itself to the old standard of strictly separating its news and opinion journalists, the paper leads its readers further into the trap of thinking that what they are reading is independent and impartial \u2013 and this misleads them about their country\u2019s centre of political and cultural gravity. \u201cEven though each day\u2019s opinion pieces are typically among our most popular journalism and our columnists are among our most trusted voices, we believe opinion is secondary to our primary mission of reporting and should represent only a portion of a healthy news diet,\u201d Sulzberger wrote in the  Columbia Journalism Review.  \u201cFor that reason, we\u2019ve long kept the Opinion department intentionally small \u2013 it represents well under a tenth of our journalistic staff \u2013 and ensured that its editorial decision-making is walled off from the newsroom.\u201d\nWhen I was editorial-page editor, Sulzberger, who declined to be interviewed on the record for this article, worried a great deal about the breakdown in the boundaries between news and opinion. At one town hall, he was confronted by a staffer upset that we in Opinion had begun doing more original reporting, which was a priority for me. Sulzberger replied he was much less worried about reporting in the Opinion coverage than by opinion in the news report \u2013 a fine moment, I thought then and think now, in his leadership. He told me once that he would like to restructure the paper to have one editor oversee all its news reporters, another all its opinion journalists and a third all its service journalists, the ones who supply guidance on buying gizmos or travelling abroad. Each of these editors would report to him. That is the kind of action the  Times  needs to take now to confront its hypocrisy and begin restoring its independence.\nThe  Times  could learn something from the  Wall Street Journal  , which has kept its journalistic poise. It has maintained a stricter separation between its news and opinion journalism, including its cultural criticism, and that has protected the integrity of its work. After I was chased out of the  Times  ,  Journal  reporters and other staff attempted a similar assault on their opinion department. Some 280 of them signed a letter listing pieces they found offensive and demanding changes in how their opinion colleagues approached their work. \u201cTheir anxieties aren\u2019t our responsibility,\u201d shrugged the  Journal  \u2019s editorial board in a note to readers after the letter was leaked. \u201cThe signers report to the news editors or other parts of the business.\u201d The editorial added, in case anyone missed the point, \u201cWe are not the  New York Times  .\u201d That was the end of it.\nUnlike the publishers of the  Journal  , however, Sulzberger is in a bind, or at least perceives himself to be. The confusion within the  Times  over its role, and the rising tide of intolerance among the reporters, the engineers, the business staff, even the subscribers \u2013 these are all problems he inherited, in more ways than one. He seems to feel constrained in confronting the paper\u2019s illiberalism by the very source of his authority. He is sensitive about the idiosyncratic way he reached the pinnacle of American news media, via his family\u2019s control of the paper\u2019s voting stock. Once, when I told him we were preparing an editorial series on nepotism within the Trump White House, he was quick to note that the  Times  was in a glass house when it came to such criticism.\nThe paradox is that in previous generations the Sulzbergers\u2019 control was the bulwark of the paper\u2019s independence. For this publisher, it seems also to be a vulnerability. He noted in the  Columbia Journalism Review  that he is \u201ca wealthy white man who succeeded a series of other wealthy white men with the same first and last name.\u201d His background, he wrote, may make him \u201cuniquely, perhaps even comically, unpersuasive\u201d in the debate over journalistic principles. That confession read like throat-clearing before his lengthy exposition of \u201cindependent journalism\u201d, and it is right for people to be aware of the blinders and biases created by their upbringing. But if he is going to instil the principles he believes in, he needs to stop worrying so much about his powers of persuasion, and start using the power he is so lucky to have.\nT  om Cotton had written two op-eds for us in Opinion, making the case for buying Greenland and defending Trump\u2019s decision to assassinate the head of the Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, General Qassem Suleimani. Adam Rubenstein, a rising talent in Opinion, had helped edit the second of these pieces. Rubenstein had brought in dozens of op-eds by then that reflected a variety of voices, ideas and politics, and had received a note of praise from Sulzberger himself, for a piece by a former congressman, Joe Walsh, a Tea Party favourite who had called for a primary challenge to Trump. But Rubenstein had a background in conservative journalism, and within the  Times  his work in soliciting pieces from conservatives had put a target on his back.\nIn early June 2020 Cotton\u2019s office pitched a piece about Twitter\u2019s curation of its platform. Cotton had tweeted that Trump should call out troops to stop the \u201canarchy, rioting and looting\u201d if \u201clocal law enforcement is overwhelmed\u201d, and Twitter had threatened to censor his account. Jim Dao, the op-ed editor, was more interested in the substance of the tweet and, via Rubenstein, asked Cotton to write an op-ed about that.\nThat was the right thing to do. Trump was starting to call for the use of troops, and on May 31st the mayor of Washington, DC, had requested that the National Guard be deployed in her city. After police gassed protesters before Trump posed for a photo in Lafayette Square on June 1st, the editorial board, which I led, weighed in against that use of force and Trump\u2019s \u201cincendiary behaviour\u201d, and the op-ed team had pieces planned for June 3rd arguing he did not have a sound basis to call out federal forces and would be wrong to do so. In keeping with the basic practice of the op-ed page, which was created to present points of view at odds with  Times  editorials, Dao owed readers the counter-argument. They also needed to know someone so influential with the president was making this argument, and how he was making it.\nI knew the piece was coming, and that Dao had asked for substantive revisions to the first draft. At the time, Rubenstein was assisting me with research for a daily newsletter I was writing, and I asked him when we met on the morning of June 3rd to make sure Cotton was distinguishing clearly between rioters and protesters. He did: \u201cA majority who seek to protest peacefully shouldn\u2019t be confused with bands of miscreants,\u201d Cotton wrote. From Cotton\u2019s perspective, it was leftist elites who were confusing the two. In the op-ed, he decried any \u201crevolting moral equivalence of rioters and looters to peaceful, law-abiding protesters\u201d.\nRubenstein also told me that in one draft Cotton had linked disapprovingly to a tweet from a  Times  reporter that could be read as expressing support for the rioters. I told Rubenstein to make sure that this link was removed. I had prohibited criticising any work, including any social-media activity, from the newsroom, unless I ran the idea by a senior newsroom editor first.\nShortly after we published the op-ed that Wednesday afternoon, some reporters tweeted their opposition to Cotton\u2019s argument. But the real action was in the  Times  \u2019s Slack channels, where reporters and other staff began not just venting but organising. They turned to the union to draw up a workplace complaint about the op-ed. At least one of the reporters who covered news media took a strong position in this internal debate: \u201cAmplifying a message that argues for MORE force only puts our own people in harm\u2019s way, and undermines the paper\u2019s commitment to their safety,\u201d this reporter argued to colleagues in Slack, going on to offer suggestions for how the union should attack the op-ed: \u201cI think it\u2019s good that a lot of us will put our names on a strong condemnation.\u201d\nThe next day, this reporter shared the byline on the  Times  story about the op-ed. That article did not mention that Cotton had distinguished between \u201cpeaceful, law-abiding protesters\u201d and \u201crioters and looters\u201d. In fact, the first sentence reported that Cotton had called for \u201cthe military to suppress protests against police violence\u201d.\nThis was \u2013 and is \u2013 wrong. You don\u2019t have to take my word for that. You can take the  Times  \u2019s. Three days later in its article on my resignation it also initially reported that Cotton had called \u201cfor military force against protesters in American cities\u201d. This time, after the article was published on the  Times  website, the editors scrambled to rewrite it, replacing \u201cmilitary force\u201d with \u201cmilitary response\u201d and \u201cprotesters\u201d with \u201ccivic unrest\u201d. That was a weaselly adjustment \u2013 Cotton wrote about criminality, not \u201cunrest\u201d \u2013 but the article at least no longer unambiguously misrepresented Cotton\u2019s argument to make it seem he was in favour of crushing democratic protest. The  Times  did not publish a correction or any note acknowledging the story had been changed.\nSeeking to influence the outcome of a story you cover, particularly without disclosing that to the reader, violates basic principles I was raised on at the  Times  . I asked the  Times  if the media reporter\u2019s behaviour was ethical. The spokeswoman, Ms Rhoades Ha, did not answer the question but instead wrote in an email that the reporter was assigned to the story after posting the messages in Slack and the \u201ceditors were unaware of those Slack messages\u201d. The reporter, apparently asked by the  Times  to write to me, immediately followed with an email that said: \u201cIn the heat of the moment, I made comments on an internal Slack channel that, as a media reporter, I should not have\u201d but that \u201cthe factual reporting I contributed to the story is not at issue.\u201d (I am not naming this journalist because I do not want to point the finger at a single reporter when, in my view, an editor should be taking responsibility for the coverage.) Ms Rhoades Ha disputes my characterisation of the after-the-fact editing of the story about my resignation. She said the editors changed the story after it was published on the website in order to \u201crefine\u201d it and \u201cadd context\u201d, and so the story did not merit a correction disclosing to the reader that changes had been made.\nI asked if it was accurate and fair to report that Cotton called for \u201cthe military to suppress protests against police violence\u201d, as the June 4th story still does. In response, Ms Rhoades Ha supplied an opinion from a  Times  lawyer which noted that Cotton called for a military presence to \u201cdeter lawbreakers\u201d. The lawyer argued that because some protesters violated curfews, failed to get permits or disperse when police ordered them to, they could be considered \u201clawbreakers\u201d, just like the rioters and looters Cotton explicitly referred to. I followed up, saying I was seeking an editorial rather than a legal opinion, and asking again whether the  Times  believed its characterisation of Cotton\u2019s argument was not just accurate, but fair. Ms Rhoades Ha again referred me to the lawyer\u2019s opinion.\nShe also defended the  Times  more broadly: \u201cThe  New York Times  believes unequivocally in the principle of independence, as has been demonstrated consistently by our journalism before and since that episode. There are countless examples of the  Times  standing strong against pressure and protest, whether from governments, companies, politicians, activist groups or even internally. In the case of the Tom Cotton op-ed, the handling of such a sensitive piece, specifically the decision to rush it into publication without key leaders having read it because it was \u201cnewsy\u201d, made it unusually vulnerable to attack. Good principles, as the Cotton op-ed demonstrated, cannot be an excuse for bad execution.\u201d\nIn retrospect what seems almost comical is that as the conflict over Cotton\u2019s op-ed unfolded within the  Times  I acted as though it was on the level, as though the staff of the  Times  would have a good-faith debate about Cotton\u2019s piece and the decision to publish it. Instead, people wanted to vent and achieve what they considered to be justice, whether through Twitter, Slack, the union or the news pages themselves. Engaging with them at all was a mistake. That first night after the op-ed was published, when I called Baquet, his sage advice was to say nothing. Give it time, he said. Let this play out. The publisher disagreed. He thought we needed to say something that night explaining why we chose to publish the piece, and so we kept heaping more logs on the fire.\nMy colleagues in Opinion, together with the  PR  team, put together a series of connected tweets describing the purpose behind publishing Cotton\u2019s op-ed. Rather than publish these tweets from the generic  Times  Opinion Twitter account, Sulzberger encouraged me to do it from my personal one, on the theory that this would humanise our defence. I doubted that would make any difference, but it was certainly my job to take responsibility. So I sent out the tweets, sticking my head in a Twitter bucket that clangs, occasionally, to this day. At the publisher\u2019s direction, I then wrote an explanation of the decision to publish the op-ed for the next day\u2019s edition of the Opinion newsletter. Reading that piece now, I think it holds up. It was not defensive and it dealt with the strongest criticisms. It concluded with a sentiment that I\u2019ve always thought journalists should bring to all their work, and which I intended as an invitation to debate. (\u201cIt is impossible to feel righteous about any of this. I know that my own view may be wrong.\u201d) But no one took me up on that.\nW  hat is worth recalling now from the bedlam of the next two days? I suppose there might be lessons for someone interested in how not to manage a corporate crisis. I began making my own mistakes that Thursday. The union condemned our publication of Cotton, for supposedly putting journalists in danger, claiming that he had called on the military \u201cto \u2018detain\u2019 and \u2018subdue\u2019 Americans protesting racism and police brutality\u201d \u2013 again, a misrepresentation of his argument. The publisher called to tell me the company was experiencing its largest sick day in history; people were turning down job offers because of the op-ed, and, he said, some people were quitting. He had been expecting for some time that the union would seek a voice in editorial decision-making; he said he thought this was the moment the union was making its move. He had clearly changed his own mind about the value of publishing the Cotton op-ed.\nI asked Dao to have our fact-checkers review the union\u2019s claims. But then I went a step further: at the publisher\u2019s request, I urged him to review the editing of the piece itself and come back to me with a list of steps we could have taken to make it better. Dao\u2019s reflex \u2013 the correct one \u2013 was to defend the piece as published. He and three other editors of varying ages, genders and races had helped edit it; it had been fact-checked, as is all our work. But I resisted, worried that we had put Sulzberger in a hard position. In Opinion we had grown accustomed to the wrath of our colleagues, but this time the publisher was in the line of fire as well.\nI told myself there was nothing false about this. There isn\u2019t an article out of the many thousands I have written or edited that I do not think, in retrospect, could have met a higher standard in some way \u2013 and Cotton\u2019s op-ed is no exception. And I thought that by saying we could have somehow made the piece better, we would dispel the heat within the  Times  but affirm the principle that it was the kind of piece we should publish. This was my last failed attempt to have the debate within the  Times  that I had been seeking for four years, about why it was important to present  Times  readers with arguments like Cotton\u2019s. The staff at the paper never wanted to have that debate. The Cotton uproar was the most extreme version of the internal reaction we faced whenever we published conservative arguments that were not simply anti-Trump. Yes, yes, of course we believe in the principle of publishing diverse views, my  Times  colleagues would say, but why  this  conservative? Why  this  argument?\nMost of the union\u2019s assertions were wrong, but in going back over the piece the fact-checker did find a minor error. Cotton had accidentally left some words from a legal opinion in quotation marks that he should have put in his own voice. Dao also dutifully itemised language that we might have softened, and said the headline, \u201cSend in the Troops\u201d should in retrospect have been made more palatable, if duller. I doubt these changes would have mattered, and to extract this list from Dao was to engage in precisely the hypocrisy I claimed to despise \u2013 that, in fact, I do despise. If Cotton needed to be held to such standards of politesse, so did everyone else. Headlines such as \u201cTom Cotton\u2019s Fascist Op-ed\u201d, the headline of a subsequent piece, should also have been tranquillised.\nAs that miserable Thursday wore on, Sulzberger, Baquet and I held a series of Zoom meetings with reporters and editors from the newsroom who wanted to discuss the op-ed. Though a handful of the participants were there to posture, these were generally constructive conversations. A couple of people, including Baquet, even had the guts to speak up in favour of publishing the op-ed. Two moments stick out. At one point, in answer to a question, Sulzberger and Baquet both said they thought the op-ed \u2013 as the  Times  union and many journalists were saying \u2013 had in fact put journalists in danger. That was the first time I realised I might be coming to the end of the road. The other was when a pop-culture reporter asked if I had read the op-ed before it was published. I said I had not. He immediately put his head down and started typing, and I should have paid attention rather than moving on to the next question. He was evidently sharing the news with the company over Slack.\nIf he had followed up, or I had, I might have explained that this was standard practice. Dao\u2019s name was on the masthead of the  New York Times  because he was in charge of the op-ed section. If I insisted on reviewing every piece, I would have been doing his job for him \u2013 and been betraying a crippling lack of trust in one of the papers\u2019 finest editors. After I departed, and other Opinion staff quit or were reassigned, the  Times  later made him Metro editor, a sign of its own continued confidence in him. Every job review I had at the  Times  urged me to step back from the daily coverage to focus on the long term. (Hilariously, one review, urging me to move faster in upending the Opinion department, instructed me to take risks and \u201cask for forgiveness not permission\u201d.)\nIt was important to me to read pieces in advance that might cause an uproar, and I had asked Dao and his deputy to alert me to any they thought would be particularly sensitive, but they did not think the Cotton piece rose to that level. I had also instituted an \u201cif-you-see-something-say-something\u201d policy in Opinion as a whole. Nobody raised a red flag with me. To be clear \u2013 I don\u2019t fault anyone for this; I mention it only as an index of how much easier it was to judge in hindsight, after publication, when a piece was explosive. In any event, if anyone had raised an alarm, I might have edited the piece differently, but that would not have changed the outcome. Given the pieces we had already published and planned to publish opposing the position Cotton argued, we would still have published it \u2013 it was, in my view at the time, the kind of viewpoint the Sulzbergers had said they wanted to see also represented in the  Times  . And the critics would hardly have been mollified had it been more persuasive.\nI learned when these meetings were over that there had been a new eruption in Slack.  Times  staff were saying that Rubenstein had been the sole editor of the op-ed. In response, Dao had gone into Slack to clarify to the entire company that he had also edited it himself. But when the  Times  posted the news article that evening, it reported, \u201cThe Op-Ed was edited by Adam Rubenstein\u201d and made no mention of Dao\u2019s statement. One of the ironies of this episode was that it was not any newsroom reporter but Rubenstein who wound up receiving death threats because of the Cotton op-ed, and it was the newsroom that put him in harm\u2019s way. I would put  Times  Opinion\u2019s standards for the editing of Cotton\u2019s op-ed up against the  Times  newsroom\u2019s standards for its coverage of the op-ed any day of the week.\nBy unhappy \u2013 but, really, also quite funny \u2013 coincidence, a meeting of the entire company had been scheduled over Zoom for the next morning. The plan had been for the newsroom to talk about its coverage of the protests. Now the only subject was going to be the op-ed. Early that morning, I got an email from Sam Dolnick, a Sulzberger cousin and a top editor at the paper, who said he felt \u201cwe\u201d \u2013 he could have only meant me \u2013 owed the whole staff \u201can apology for appearing to place an abstract idea like open debate over the value of our colleagues\u2019 lives, and their safety\u201d. He was worried that I and my colleagues had unintentionally sent a message to other people at the  Times  that: \u201cWe don\u2019t care about their full humanity and their security as much as we care about our ideas.\u201d\nLike his cousin, the publisher, Dolnick is a smart guy with a good heart, and I know he meant well. But I was staggered by his email, by how different his conception was of the role of journalism, and of my own commitment to it. Did he really think I saw this as an academic exercise, or some kind of game? My mother survived the Holocaust in Poland, and it took years for her and the remnant of our family to be admitted to the United States. Did he really think I believed ideas had no consequences for people\u2019s lives? I guess I was also fed up. I wrote to the publisher, who had been copied in on Dolnick\u2019s note.\n\u201cI know you don\u2019t like it when I talk about principles at a moment like this,\u201d I began. But I viewed the journalism I had been doing, at the  Times  and before that at the  Atlantic  , in very different terms from the ones Dolnick presumed. \u201cI don\u2019t think of our work as an abstraction without meaning for people\u2019s lives \u2013 quite the opposite,\u201d I continued. \u201cThe whole point \u2013 the reason I do this \u2013 is to have an impact on their lives to the good. I have always believed that putting ideas, including potentially dangerous one[s], out in the public is vital to ensuring they are debated and, if dangerous, discarded.\u201d It was, I argued, in \u201cedge cases like this that principles are tested\u201d, and if my position was judged wrong then \u201cI am out of step with the times.\u201d But, I concluded, \u201cI don\u2019t think of us as some kind of debating society without implications for the real world and I\u2019ve never been unmindful of my colleagues\u2019 humanity.\u201d\nSulzberger did not reply. But in the end, one thing he and I surely agree on is that I was, in fact, out of step with the  Times  . It may have raised me as a journalist \u2013 and invested so much in educating me to what were once its standards \u2013 but I did not belong there any more.\nIn retrospect, it seems clear that I was done by then. The executive committee gathered that morning to prepare, and for the first time I was not invited to join them. They had solicited questions in advance, and I got a glimpse at the list only as the company-wide meeting was about to start. I did not hear from Sulzberger, but the speechwriter who drafted many of his remarks, Alex Levy, contacted me just before the meeting began to tell me to use whatever question I got first to apologise, and at some point to acknowledge my privilege.\nA Zoom call with a couple of thousand people is a disorienting experience, particularly when many of them are not particularly mindful of your \u201cfull humanity\u201d. I do not recommend it. As my first turn to speak came up, I was still struggling with what I should apologise for. I was not going to apologise for denying my colleagues\u2019 humanity or endangering their lives. I had not done those things. I was not going to apologise for publishing the op-ed. Finally, I came up with something that felt true. I told the meeting that I was sorry for the pain that my leadership of Opinion had caused. What a pathetic thing to say. I did not think to add, because I\u2019d lost track of this truth myself by then, that opinion journalism that never causes pain is not journalism. It can\u2019t hope to move society forward.\nBaquet spoke movingly about how, as a black man, he was vulnerable in ways a white man was not when he left his apartment wearing a hoodie and a mask, to ward off covid. Speaking into the void, via the unblinking eye above my computer screen, I said I knew, as a white man, I was in a very different position. When I stepped out into the street, I was protected by my privilege. But I added that I did know what it was like to be a reporter out in the field, alone, surrounded by armed, hostile people. I knew what it was like to be shot at, and to see a fellow journalist shot in front of me. And so I took to heart the criticism that I\u2019d endangered my colleagues. I\u2019d been raised \u2013 raised at the  Times  \u2013 to believe the best way to confront ideas that some people might consider dangerous was to bring them out into the open. But I recognised that many of my colleagues thought that was wrong. And I said I would like to debate with them whether it was time to discard the old approach, and, if that was the case, what role opinion journalism should have at the  Times  .\nAs I look back at my notes of that awful day, I don\u2019t regret what I said. Even during that meeting, I was still hoping the blow-up might at last give me the chance either to win support for what I had been asked to do, or to clarify once and for all that the rules for journalism had changed at the  Times  .\nBut no one wanted to talk about that. Nor did they want to hear about all the voices of vulnerable or underprivileged people we had been showcasing in Opinion, or the ambitious new journalism we were doing. Instead, my  Times  colleagues demanded to know things such as the names of every editor who had had a role in the Cotton piece. Having seen what happened to Rubenstein I refused to tell them. A Slack channel had been set up to solicit feedback in real time during the meeting, and it was filling with hate. The meeting ran long, and finally came to a close after 90 minutes.\nOne last dismal task lay ahead. I had agreed to take the rare step of posting an \u201cEditor\u2019s Note\u201d on the Cotton op-ed describing what was supposedly wrong with it, and the publisher had asked a newsroom editor to draft it for him. Although I had urged Dao to come up with \u201cprocess\u201d criticisms, I tried to insist, as did Dao, that the note make clear the Cotton piece was within our editorial bounds. Sulzberger said he felt the  Times  could afford to be \u201csilent\u201d on that question. In the end the note went far further in repudiating the piece than I anticipated, saying it should never have been published at all. The next morning I was told to resign.\nW  hat an intense period that was, inside the  Times  and across America. In spring 2020 covid-19 chased people into their homes in fear, and then, as spring turned to summer, the murder of George Floyd brought many of them out into the streets in anger. Or maybe the emotions were the other way around. We were also angry at the virus, and at the government\u2019s handling of it, and at our employers; and we were afraid of the police, or of the rioters, or of white people or black people, Democrats or Republicans. It was a terrible moment for the country. By the traditional \u2013 and perverse \u2013 logic of journalism, that should also have made it an inspiring time to be a reporter, writer or editor. Journalists are supposed to run towards scenes that others are fleeing, towards hard truths others need to know, towards consequential ideas they would prefer to ignore.\nBut fear got all mixed up with anger inside the  Times  , too, along with a desire to act locally in solidarity with the national movement. That energy found a focus in the Cotton op-ed. Scattered as we were by covid, none of us at the  Times  could speak face to face, and nobody was thinking very clearly. That seems understandable, given the frantic pile-up of circumstances. It would be reasonable now for all of us \u2013 me, Sulzberger, the journalists who were declaring their fright on Twitter \u2013 to look back, shake our heads and say that was a crazy time, and we all made some mistakes.\nBut the  Times  is not good at acknowledging mistakes. Indeed, one of my own, within the  Times  culture, was to take responsibility for any mistakes my department made, and even some it didn\u2019t. To Sulzberger, the meltdown over Cotton\u2019s op-ed and my departure in disgrace are explained and justified by a failure of editorial \u201cprocess\u201d. As he put it in an interview with the  New Yorker  this summer, after publishing his piece in the  Columbia Journalism Review  , Cotton\u2019s piece was not \u201cperfectly fact-checked\u201d and the editors had not \u201cthought about the headline and presentation\u201d. He contrasted the execution of Cotton\u2019s opinion piece with that of a months-long investigation the newsroom did of Donald Trump\u2019s taxes (which was not \u201cperfectly fact-checked\u201d, as it happens \u2013 it required a correction). He did not explain why, if the  Times  was an independent publication, an op-ed making a mainstream conservative argument should have to meet such different standards from an op-ed making any other kind of argument, such as for the abolition of the police. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough just to have the principle and wave it around,\u201d he said. \u201cYou also have to execute on it.\u201d\nTo me, extolling the virtue of independent journalism in the pages of the  Columbia Journalism Review  is how you wave a principle around. Publishing a piece like Cotton\u2019s is how you execute on it. As Sulzberger also wrote in the  Review  , \u201cIndependent journalism, especially in a pluralistic democracy, should err on the side of treating areas of serious political contest as open, unsettled, and in need of further inquiry.\u201d It matters that conflicting views do not just appear before different audiences in politically rivalrous publications or cable news networks, but instead in the same forum, before the same readers, subject to the same standards for fact and argumentation. That is also, by the way, an important means by which politicians, like Cotton, can learn, by speaking to audiences who are not inclined to nod along with them. That was our ambition for  Times  Opinion \u2013 or mine, I guess. Americans can shout about their lack of free speech all they want, but they will never be able to overcome their differences, and deal with any of their real problems, if they do not learn to listen to each other again.\nIf Sulzberger must insist on comparing the execution of the Cotton op-ed with that of the most ambitious of newsroom projects, let him compare it with something really important, the 1619 Project, which commemorated the 400th anniversary of the arrival of enslaved Africans in Virginia. Like Cotton\u2019s piece, the 1619 Project was fact-checked and copy-edited (most of the  Times  newsroom does not fact-check or copy-edit articles, but the magazine does). But it nevertheless contained mistakes, as journalism often does. Some of these mistakes ignited a firestorm among historians and other readers.\nAnd, like Cotton\u2019s piece, the 1619 Project was presented in a way the  Times  later judged to be too provocative. The  Times  declared that the 1619 Project \u201caims to reframe the country\u2019s history, understanding 1619 as our true founding\u201d. That bold statement \u2013 a declaration of  Times  fact, not opinion, since it came from the newsroom \u2013 outraged many Americans who venerated 1776 as the founding. The  Times  later stealthily erased it from the digital version of the project, but was caught doing so by a writer for the publication  Quillette  . Sulzberger told me during the initial uproar that the top editors in the newsroom \u2013 not just Baquet but his deputy \u2013 had not reviewed the audacious statement of purpose, one of the biggest editorial claims the paper has ever made. They also, of course, did not edit all the pieces themselves, trusting the magazine\u2019s editors to do that work.\nIf the 1619 Project and the Cotton op-ed shared the same supposed flaws and excited similar outrage, how come that one is lauded as a landmark success and the other is a sackable offence? In asking this, I am not running down the 1619 Project. It was excellent, above all because it made arguments readers should hear and consider. And to be clear: unlike Sulzberger, I do not see any equivalence between any huge project like that and a single op-ed piece. The parallel is absurd. I am comparing them only to meet Sulzberger on his terms, in order to illuminate what he is trying to elide. What distinguished the Cotton piece was not an error, or strong language, or that I didn\u2019t edit it personally. What distinguished that op-ed was not process. It was politics. It is one thing for the  Times  to aggravate historians, or conservatives, or even old-school liberals who believe in open debate. It has become quite another for the  Times  to challenge some members of its own staff with ideas that might contradict their view of the world.\nThe lessons of the incident are not about how to write a headline but about how much the  Times  has changed \u2013 how digital technology, the paper\u2019s new business model and the rise of new ideals among its staff have altered its understanding of the boundary between news and opinion, and of the relationship between truth and justice. Ejecting me was one way to avoid confronting the question of which values the  Times  is committed to. Waving around the word \u201cprocess\u201d is another.\nWhat still seems most striking about the Cotton episode is how out of sync the leaders of the paper were with the ascendant, illiberal values within it. Cotton\u2019s essay brought into focus conflicts over the role of journalism that had been growing within the  Times  for years, and that the leadership has largely ducked away from. Is it journalism\u2019s role to salt wounds or to salve them, to promote debates or settle them, to ask or to answer? Is its proper posture humble or righteous? As journalists trained in what was once the conventional way, with the old set of principles, Sulzberger, Baquet and I reacted similarly to Cotton\u2019s essay: here\u2019s a potentially consequential idea from an influential voice. It may make readers uncomfortable, and they should know about it and evaluate it partly for that very reason.\nTimes  colleagues who were frightened or angry about the piece had the opposite view: that readers should not hear Cotton\u2019s argument. To expose them to it was to risk that they might be persuaded by an elected politician.\nAs he asserts the independence of  Times  Times  New Yorker\nTimes\nTimes  Times\nTimes  Times\nTimes  Times  Washington Post  Times  Times  Times\nJames Bennet  is",
                            "html": "<p><span> A </span> re we truly so precious?\u201d Dean Baquet, the executive editor of the <i> New York Times </i> , asked me one Wednesday evening in June 2020. I was the editorial-page editor of the <i> Times </i> , and we had just published an op-ed by <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/united-states/2016/10/15/growing-cotton-in-iowa\"> Tom Cotton </a> , a senator from Arkansas, that was outraging many members of the <i> Times </i> staff. America\u2019s conscience had been shocked days before by images of a white police officer kneeling on the neck of a black man, George Floyd, until he died. It was a frenzied time in America, assaulted by covid-19, scalded by police barbarism. Throughout the country <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/06/01/history-is-repeated-in-protests-at-the-death-of-george-floyd\"> protesters were on the march </a> . Substantive reform of the police, so long delayed, suddenly seemed like a real possibility, but so did violence and political backlash. In some cities rioting and looting had broken out. </p><p> It was the kind of crisis in which journalism could fulfil its highest ambitions of helping readers understand the world, in order to fix it, and in the <i> Times </i> \u2019s Opinion section, which I oversaw, we were pursuing our role of presenting <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2020/07/16/how-objectivity-in-journalism-became-a-matter-of-opinion\"> debate from all sides </a> . We had published pieces arguing against the idea of relying on troops to stop the violence, and one urging abolition of the police altogether. But Cotton, an army veteran, was calling for the use of troops to protect lives and businesses from rioters. Some <i> Times </i> reporters and other staff were taking to what was then called Twitter, now called X, to attack the decision to publish his argument, for fear he would persuade <i> Times </i> readers to support his proposal and it would be enacted. The next day the <i> Times </i> \u2019s union\u2014its unit of the NewsGuild- <small> CWA </small> \u2014would issue a statement calling the op-ed \u201ca clear threat to the health and safety of the journalists we represent\u201d. </p><p> The <i> Times </i> had endured many cycles of Twitter outrage for one story or opinion piece or another. It was never fun; it felt like sticking your head in a metal bucket while people were banging it with hammers. The publisher, A.G. Sulzberger, who was about two years into the job, understood why we\u2019d published the op-ed. He had some criticisms about packaging; he said the editors should add links to other op-eds we\u2019d published with a different view. But he\u2019d emailed me that afternoon, saying: \u201cI get and support the reason for including the piece,\u201d because, he thought, Cotton\u2019s view had the support of the White House as well as a majority of the Senate. As the clamour grew, he asked me to call Baquet, the paper\u2019s most senior editor. </p><p> Like me, Baquet seemed taken aback by the criticism that <i> Times </i> readers shouldn\u2019t hear what Cotton had to say. Cotton had a lot of influence with the White House, Baquet noted, and he could well be making his argument directly to the president, Donald Trump. Readers should know about it. Cotton was also a possible future contender for the White House himself, Baquet added. And, besides, Cotton was far from alone: lots of Americans agreed with him\u2014most of them, according to some polls. \u201cAre we truly so precious?\u201d Baquet asked again, with a note of wonder and frustration. </p><p> The answer, it turned out, was yes. Less than three days later, on Saturday morning, Sulzberger called me at home and, with an icy anger that still puzzles and saddens me, demanded my resignation. I got mad, too, and said he\u2019d have to fire me. I thought better of that later. I called him back and agreed to resign, flattering myself that I was being noble. </p><p> Whether or not American democracy endures, a central question historians are sure to ask about this era is why America came to elect Donald Trump, promoting him from a symptom of the country\u2019s institutional, political and social degradation to its agent-in-chief. There are many reasons for Trump\u2019s ascent, but changes in the American news media played a critical role. Trump\u2019s manipulation and every one of his political lies became more powerful because journalists had forfeited what had always been most valuable about their work: their credibility as arbiters of truth and brokers of ideas, which for more than a century, despite all of journalism\u2019s flaws and failures, had been a bulwark of how Americans govern themselves. </p><p> I hope those historians will also be able to tell the story of how journalism found its footing again \u2013 how editors, reporters and readers, too, came to recognise that journalism needed to change to fulfil its potential in restoring the health of American politics. As Trump\u2019s nomination and possible re-election loom, that work could not be more urgent. </p><p> I think Sulzberger shares this analysis. In interviews and his own writings, including an essay earlier this year for the <i> Columbia Journalism Review </i> , he has defended \u201cindependent journalism\u201d, or, as I understand him, fair-minded, truth-seeking journalism that aspires to be open and objective. It\u2019s good to hear the publisher speak up in defence of such values, some of which have fallen out of fashion not just with journalists at the <i> Times </i> and other mainstream publications but at some of the most prestigious schools of journalism. Until that miserable Saturday morning I thought I was standing shoulder-to-shoulder with him in a struggle to revive them. I thought, and still think, that no American institution could have a better chance than the <i> Times </i> , by virtue of its principles, its history, its people and its hold on the attention of influential Americans, to lead the resistance to the corruption of political and intellectual life, to overcome the encroaching dogmatism and intolerance. </p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.design-system.economist.com/assets/latest/common/static/images/image/image-placeholder.svg\"><figcaption class=\"css-18w36g1 edweubf2\"><span> Tom Cotton speaking at the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in 2020 </span></figcaption></figure><p> But Sulzberger seems to underestimate the struggle he is in, that all journalism and indeed America itself is in. In describing the essential qualities of independent journalism in his essay, he unspooled a list of admirable traits \u2013 empathy, humility, curiosity and so forth. These qualities have for generations been helpful in contending with the <i> Times </i> \u2019s familiar problem, which is liberal bias. I have no doubt Sulzberger believes in them. Years ago he demonstrated them himself as a reporter, covering the American Midwest as a real place full of three-dimensional people, and it would be nice if they were enough to deal with the challenge of this era, too. But, on their own, these qualities have no chance against the <i> Times </i> \u2019s new, more dangerous problem, which is in crucial respects the opposite of the old one. </p><p> The <i> Times </i> \u2019s problem has metastasised from liberal bias to illiberal bias, from an inclination to favour one side of the national debate to an impulse to shut debate down altogether. All the empathy and humility in the world will not mean much against the pressures of intolerance and tribalism without an invaluable quality that Sulzberger did not emphasise: courage. </p><p> Don\u2019t get me wrong. Most journalism obviously doesn\u2019t require anything like the bravery expected of a soldier, police officer or protester. But far more than when I set out to become a journalist, doing the work right today demands a particular kind of courage: not just the devil-may-care courage to choose a profession on the brink of the abyss; not just the bulldog courage to endlessly pick yourself up and embrace the ever-evolving technology; but also, in an era when polarisation and social media viciously enforce rigid orthodoxies, the moral and intellectual courage to take the other side seriously and to report truths and ideas that your own side demonises for fear they will harm its cause. </p><p> One of the glories of embracing illiberalism is that, like Trump, you are always right about everything, and so you are justified in shouting disagreement down. In the face of this, leaders of many workplaces and boardrooms across America find that it is so much easier to compromise than to confront \u2013 to give a little ground today in the belief you can ultimately bring people around. This is how reasonable Republican leaders lost control of their party to Trump and how liberal-minded college presidents lost control of their campuses. And it is why the leadership of the <i> New York Times </i> is losing control of its principles. </p><p> Over the decades the <i> Times </i> and other mainstream news organisations failed plenty of times to live up to their commitments to integrity and open-mindedness. The relentless struggle against biases and preconceptions, rather than the achievement of a superhuman objective omniscience, is what mattered. As everyone knows, the internet knocked the industry off its foundations. Local newspapers were the proving ground between college campuses and national newsrooms. As they disintegrated, the national news media lost a source of seasoned reporters and many Americans lost a journalism whose truth they could verify with their own eyes. As the country became more polarised, the national media followed the money by serving partisan audiences the versions of reality they preferred. This relationship proved self-reinforcing. As Americans became freer to choose among alternative versions of reality, their polarisation intensified. When I was at the <i> Times </i> , the newsroom editors worked hardest to keep Washington coverage open and unbiased, no easy task in the Trump era. And there are still people, in the Washington bureau and across the <i> Times </i> , doing work as fine as can be found in American journalism. But as the top editors let bias creep into certain areas of coverage, such as culture, lifestyle and business, that made the core harder to defend and undermined the authority of even the best reporters. </p><p> There have been signs the <i> Times </i> is trying to recover the courage of its convictions. The paper was slow to display much curiosity about the hard question of the proper medical protocols for trans children; but once it did, the editors defended their coverage against the inevitable criticism. For any counter-revolution to succeed, the leadership will need to show courage worthy of the paper\u2019s bravest reporters and opinion columnists, the ones who work in war zones or explore ideas that make illiberal staff members shudder. As Sulzberger told me in the past, returning to the old standards will require agonising change. He saw that as the gradual work of many years, but I think he is mistaken. To overcome the cultural and commercial pressures the <i> Times </i> faces, particularly given the severe test posed by another Trump candidacy and possible presidency, its publisher and senior editors will have to be bolder than that. </p><p> Since Adolph Ochs bought the paper in 1896, one of the most inspiring things the <i> Times </i> has said about itself is that it does its work \u201cwithout fear or favour\u201d. That is not true of the institution today \u2013 it cannot be, not when its journalists are afraid to trust readers with a mainstream conservative argument such as Cotton\u2019s, and its leaders are afraid to say otherwise. As preoccupied as it is with the question of why so many Americans have lost trust in it, the <i> Times </i> is failing to face up to one crucial reason: that it has lost faith in Americans, too. </p><p> For now, to assert that the <i> Times </i> plays by the same rules it always has is to commit a hypocrisy that is transparent to conservatives, dangerous to liberals and bad for the country as a whole. It makes the <i> Times </i> too easy for conservatives to dismiss and too easy for progressives to believe. The reality is that the <i> Times </i> is becoming the publication through which America\u2019s progressive elite talks to itself about an America that does not really exist. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20231213_1843_NYT_02.jpg\"><figcaption class=\"css-18w36g1 edweubf2\"><span> James Bennet ( <i> second left </i> ) with Hillary Clinton ( <i> far right </i> ) on her trip as First Lady to north Africa in 1999 </span></figcaption></figure><p> It is hard to imagine a path back to saner American politics that does not traverse a common ground of shared fact. It is equally hard to imagine how America\u2019s diversity can continue to be a source of strength, rather than become a fatal flaw, if Americans are afraid or unwilling to listen to each other. I suppose it is also pretty grandiose to think you might help fix all that. But that hope, to me, is what makes journalism worth doing. </p><p><span> T </span> he <i> New York Tim </i> es taught me how to do daily journalism. I joined the paper, for my first stint, in the pre-internet days, in an era of American journalism so different that it was almost another profession. Back in 1991 the <i> Times </i> was anxious not about a print business that was collapsing but about an industry so robust that Long Island <i> Newsday </i> was making a push into New York City. A newspaper war was under way, and the <i> Times </i> was fighting back by expanding its Metro desk, hiring reporters and opening bureaus in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. </p><p> Metro was the biggest news desk. New reporters had to do rotations of up to a year there to learn the culture and folkways of the paper. Baquet, surely among the greatest investigative journalists America has produced, was then in Metro. I was brought on as a probationary reporter, with a year to prove myself, and like other new hires was put through a series of assignments at the low end of the hierarchy. </p><p> After about six months the Metro editor, Gerald Boyd, asked me to take a walk with him, as it turned out, to deliver a harsh lesson in <i> Times </i> ian ambition and discipline. Chain-smoking, speaking in his whispery, peculiarly high-pitched voice, he kicked my ass from one end of Times Square to the other. He had taken a chance hiring me, and he was disappointed. There was nothing special about my stories. At the rate I was going, I had no chance of making it onto the paper. </p><p> The next day was a Saturday, and I reached Boyd at home through the Metro desk to rattle off the speech I\u2019d endlessly rehearsed while staring at the ceiling all night. The gist was that the desk had kept me chasing small-bore stories, blah blah blah. Boyd sounded less surprised than amused to hear from me, and soon gave me a new assignment, asking me to spend three months covering the elderly, one of several new \u201cmini-beats\u201d on subjects the desk had overlooked. </p><p> I was worried there were good reasons this particular beat had been ignored. At 26, as one of the youngest reporters on the desk, I was also not an obvious candidate for the role of house expert on the wise and grey. But Boyd assigned me to an excellent editor, Suzanne Daley, and as I began studying the city\u2019s elderly and interviewing experts and actual old people, I began to discover the rewards granted any serious reporter: that when you acknowledge how little you know, looking in at a world from the outside brings a special clarity. </p><p> The subject was more complicated and richer than I imagined, and every person had stories to tell. I wrote about hunger, <small> AIDS </small> and romance among the elderly, about old comedians telling old jokes to old people in senior centres. As I reported on Jews who had fled Germany to settle in Washington Heights or black Americans who had left the Jim Crow south to settle in Bushwick, Brooklyn, it dawned on me that, thanks to Boyd, I was covering the history of the world in the 20th century through the eyes of those who had lived it. </p><p> After joining the permanent staff, I went, again in humbling ignorance, to Detroit, to cover the auto companies\u2019 \u2013 and the city\u2019s \u2013 struggle to recapture their former glory. And again I had a chance to learn, in this case, everything from how the largest companies in the world were run, to what it was like to work the line or the sales floor, to the struggle and dignity of life in one of America\u2019s most captivating cities. \u201cWe still have a long way to go,\u201d Rosa Parks told me, when I interviewed her after she had been robbed and beaten in her home on Detroit\u2019s west side one August night in 1994. \u201cAnd so many of our children are going astray.\u201d </p><p> I began to write about presidential politics two years later, in 1996, and as the most inexperienced member of the team was assigned to cover a long-shot Republican candidate, Pat Buchanan. I packed a bag for a four-day reporting trip and did not return home for six weeks. Buchanan campaigned on an eccentric fusion of social conservatism and statist economic policies, along with coded appeals to racism and antisemitism, that 30 years earlier had elevated George Wallace and 20 years later would be rebranded as Trumpism. He also campaigned with conviction, humour and even joy, a combination I have rarely witnessed. As a Democrat from a family of Democrats, a graduate of Yale and a blossom of the imagined meritocracy, I had my first real chance, at Buchanan\u2019s rallies, to see the world through the eyes of stalwart opponents of abortion, immigration and the relentlessly rising tide of modernity. </p><p> The task of making the world intelligible was even greater in my first foreign assignment. I arrived in Jerusalem a week before the attacks of September 11th 2001, just after the second intifada had broken out. I had been to the Middle East just once, as a White House reporter covering President Bill Clinton. \u201cWell, in at the deep end,\u201d the foreign editor, Roger Cohen, told me before I left. To spend time with the perpetrators and victims of violence in the Middle East, to listen hard to the reciprocal and reinforcing stories of new and ancient grievances, is to confront the tragic truth that there can be justice on more than one side of a conflict. More than ever, it seemed to me that a reporter gave up something in renouncing the taking of sides: possibly the moral high ground, certainly the psychological satisfaction of righteous anger. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20231213_1843_NYT_03.jpg\"><figcaption class=\"css-18w36g1 edweubf2\"><span> Pat Buchanan during the New Hampshire primary </span></figcaption></figure><p> But there was a compensating moral and psychological privilege that came with aspiring to journalistic neutrality and open-mindedness, despised as they might understandably be by partisans. Unlike the duelling politicians and advocates of all kinds, unlike the corporate chieftains and their critics, unlike even the sainted non-profit workers, you did not have to pretend things were simpler than they actually were. You did not have to go along with everything that any tribe said. You did not have to pretend that the good guys, much as you might have respected them, were right about everything, or that the bad guys, much as you might have disdained them, never had a point. You did not, in other words, ever have to lie. </p><p> This fundamental honesty was vital for readers, because it equipped them to make better, more informed judgments about the world. Sometimes it might shock or upset them by failing to conform to their picture of reality. But it also granted them the respect of acknowledging that they were able to work things out for themselves. </p><p> What a gift it was to be taught and trusted as I was by my editors \u2013 to be a reporter with licence to ask anyone anything, to experience the whole world as a school and every source and subject as a teacher. I left after 15 years, in 2006, when I had the chance to become editor of the <i> Atlantic </i> . Rather than starting out on yet another beat at the <i> Times </i> , I felt ready to put my experience to work and ambitious for the responsibility to shape coverage myself. It was also obvious how much the internet was changing journalism. I was eager to figure out how to use it, and anxious about being at the mercy of choices by others, in a time not just of existential peril for the industry, but maybe of opportunity. </p><p> The <i> Atlantic </i> did not aspire to the same role as the <i> Times </i> . It did not promise to serve up the news of the day without any bias. But it was to opinion journalism what the <i> Times </i> \u2019s reporting was supposed to be to news: honest and open to the world. The question was what the magazine\u2019s 19th-century claim of intellectual independence \u2013 to be \u201cof no party or clique\u201d \u2013 should mean in the digital era. </p><p> Those were the glory days of the blog, and we hit on the idea of creating a living op-ed page, a collective of bloggers with different points of view but a shared intellectual honesty who would argue out the meaning of the news of the day. They were brilliant, gutsy writers, and their disagreements were deep enough that I used to joke that my main work as editor was to prevent fistfights. </p><p> The lessons we learned from adapting the <i> Atlantic </i> to the internet washed back into print. Under its owner, David Bradley, my colleagues and I distilled our purpose as publishing big arguments about big ideas. We made some mistakes \u2013 that goes along with any serious journalism ambitious to make a change, and to embrace change itself \u2013 but we also began producing some of the most important work in American journalism: Nicholas Carr on whether Google was \u201cmaking us stupid\u201d; Hanna Rosin on \u201cthe end of men\u201d; Taylor Branch on \u201cthe shame of college sports\u201d; Ta-Nehisi Coates on \u201cthe case for reparations\u201d; Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt on \u201cthe coddling of the American mind\u201d. </p><p> I was starting to see some effects of the new campus politics within the <i> Atlantic </i> . A promising new editor had created a digital form for aspiring freelancers to fill out, and she wanted to ask them to disclose their racial and sexual identity. Why? Because, she said, if we were to write about the trans community, for example, we would ask a trans person to write the story. There was a good argument for that, I acknowledged, and it sometimes might be the right answer. But as I thought about the old people, auto workers and abortion opponents I had learned from, I told her there was also an argument for correspondents who brought an outsider\u2019s ignorance, along with curiosity and empathy, to the story. </p><p> A journalism that starts out assuming it knows the answers, it seemed to me then, and seems even more so to me now, can be far less valuable to the reader than a journalism that starts out with a humbling awareness that it knows nothing. \u201cIn truly effective thinking\u201d, Walter Lippmann wrote 100 years ago in \u201cPublic Opinion\u201d, \u201cthe prime necessity is to liquidate judgments, regain an innocent eye, disentangle feelings, be curious and open-hearted.\u201d Alarmed by the shoddy journalism of his day, Lippmann was calling for journalists to struggle against their ignorance and assumptions in order to help Americans resist the increasingly sophisticated tools of propagandists. As the <i> Atlantic </i> made its digital transition, one thing I preached was that we could not cling to any tradition or convention, however hallowed, for its own sake, but only if it was relevant to the needs of readers today. In the age of the internet it is hard even for a child to sustain an \u201cinnocent eye\u201d, but the alternative for journalists remains as dangerous as ever, to become propagandists. America has more than enough of those already. </p><p> What we did together at the <i> Atlantic </i> worked. We dramatically increased the magazine\u2019s audience and influence while making it profitable for the first time in generations. After I had spent ten years as editor, the last few as co-president, the publisher, A.G. Sulzberger\u2019s father, also an Arthur Sulzberger, asked me to return to the <i> Times </i> as editorial-page editor. </p><p> His offer, I thought, would give me the chance to do the kind of journalism I loved with more resources and greater effect. The freedom Opinion had to experiment with voice and point of view meant that it would be more able than the <i> Times </i> newsroom to take advantage of the tools of digital journalism, from audio to video to graphics. Opinion writers could also break out of limiting print conventions and do more in-depth, reported columns and editorials. Though the Opinion department, which then had about 100 staff, was a fraction the size of the newsroom, with more than 1,300, Opinion\u2019s work had outsized reach. Most important, the <i> Times </i> , probably more than any other American institution, could influence the way society approached debate and engagement with opposing views. If <i> Times </i> Opinion demonstrated the same kind of intellectual courage and curiosity that my colleagues at the <i> Atlantic </i> had shown, I hoped, the rest of the media would follow. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20231213_1843_NYT_04.jpg\"><figcaption class=\"css-18w36g1 edweubf2\"><span> A.G. Sulzberger, publisher of the <i> New York Times </i></span></figcaption></figure><p> No doubt Sulzberger\u2019s offer also appealed not just to my loyalty to the <i> Times </i> , but to my ambition as well. I would report directly to the publisher, and I was immediately seen, inside and outside the paper, as a candidate for the top job. I had hoped being in Opinion would exempt me from the infamous political games of the newsroom, but it did not, and no doubt my old colleagues felt I was playing such games myself. Fairly quickly, though, I realised two things: first, that if I did my job as I thought it should be done, and as the Sulzbergers said they wanted me to do it, I would be too polarising internally ever to lead the newsroom; second, that I did not want that job, though no one but my wife believed me when I said that. </p><p> It was 2016, a presidential-election year, and I had been gone from the <i> Times </i> for a decade. Although many of my old colleagues had also left in the interim and the <i> Times </i> had moved into a new glass-and-steel tower, I otherwise had little idea how much things had changed. When I looked around the Opinion department, change was not what I perceived. Excellent writers and editors were doing excellent work. But the department\u2019s journalism was consumed with politics and foreign affairs in an era when readers were also fascinated by changes in technology, business, science and culture. </p><p> The Opinion department mocked the paper\u2019s claim to value diversity. It did not have a single black editor. The large staff of op-ed editors contained only a couple of women. Although the 11 columnists were individually admirable, only two of them were women and only one was a person of colour. (The <i> Times </i> had not appointed a black columnist until the 1990s, and had only employed two in total.) Not only did they all focus on politics and foreign affairs, but during the 2016 campaign, no columnist shared, in broad terms, the worldview of the ascendant progressives of the Democratic Party, incarnated by Bernie Sanders. And only two were conservative. </p><p> This last fact was of particular concern to the elder Sulzberger. He told me the <i> Times </i> needed more conservative voices, and that its own editorial line had become predictably left-wing. \u201cToo many liberals,\u201d read my notes about the Opinion line-up from a meeting I had with him and Mark Thompson, then the chief executive, as I was preparing to rejoin the paper. \u201cEven conservatives are liberals\u2019 idea of a conservative.\u201d The last note I took from that meeting was: \u201cCan\u2019t ignore 150m conservative Americans.\u201d </p><p> With my Opinion colleagues, I set out to deal with this long list of needs. I restructured the department, changing everybody\u2019s role and, using buyouts, changing people as well. It was too much, too fast; it rocked the department, and my colleagues and I made mistakes amid the turmoil, including one that brought a libel suit from John McCain\u2019s vice-presidential running-mate, Sarah Palin, dismissed twice by a judge and once by a jury but endlessly appealed on procedural grounds. Yet we also did more in four years to diversify the line-up of writers by identity, ideology and expertise than the <i> Times </i> had in the previous century; we published more ambitious projects than Opinion had ever attempted. We won two Pulitzer prizes in four years \u2013 as many as the department had in the previous 20. </p><p> As I knew from my time at the <i> Atlantic, </i> this kind of structural transformation can be frightening and even infuriating for those understandably proud of things as they are. It is hard on everyone. But experience at the <i> Atlantic </i> also taught me that pursuing new ways of doing journalism in pursuit of venerable institutional principles created enthusiasm for change. I expected that same dynamic to allay concerns at the <i> Times </i> . </p><p> In that same statement in 1896, after committing the <i> Times </i> to pursue the news without fear or favour, Ochs promised to \u201cinvite intelligent discussion from all shades of opinion\u201d. So adding new voices, some more progressive and others more conservative, and more journalists of diverse identities and backgrounds, fulfilled the paper\u2019s historic purpose. If Opinion published a wider range of views, it would help frame a set of shared arguments that corresponded to, and drew upon, the set of shared facts coming from the newsroom. On the right and left, America\u2019s elites now talk within their tribes, and get angry or contemptuous on those occasions when they happen to overhear the other conclave. If they could be coaxed to agree what they were arguing about, and the rules by which they would argue about it, opinion journalism could serve a foundational need of the democracy by fostering diverse and inclusive debate. Who could be against that? </p><p> Out of naivety or arrogance, I was slow to recognise that at the <i> Times </i> , unlike at the <i> Atlantic </i> , these values were no longer universally accepted, let alone esteemed. When I first took the job, I felt some days as if I\u2019d parachuted onto one of those Pacific islands still held by Japanese soldiers who didn\u2019t know that the world beyond the waves had changed. Eventually, it sank in that my snotty joke was actually on me: I was the one ignorantly fighting a battle that was already lost. The old liberal embrace of inclusive debate that reflected the country\u2019s breadth of views had given way to a new intolerance for the opinions of roughly half of American voters. New progressive voices were celebrated within the <i> Times </i> . But in contrast to the <i> Wall Street Journal </i> and the <i> Washington Post, </i> conservative voices \u2013 even eloquent anti-Trump conservative voices \u2013 were despised, regardless of how many leftists might surround them. (President Trump himself submitted one op-ed during my time, but we could not raise it to our standards \u2013 his people would not agree to the edits we asked for.) </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20231213_1843_NYT_05.jpg\"></figure><p> About a year after the 2016 election, the <i> Times </i> newsroom published a profile of a man from Ohio who had attended the rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, at which a white nationalist drove his car into a crowd of protesters, killing one. It was a terrifying piece. The man had four cats, listened to National Public Radio, and had registered at Target for a muffin pan before his recent wedding. In exploring his evolution from \u201cvaguely leftist rock musician to ardent libertarian to fascist activist\u201d the article rang an alarm about how \u201cthe election of President Donald Trump helped open a space for people like him\u201d. </p><p> The profile was in keeping with the <i> Times </i> \u2019s tradition of confronting readers with the confounding reality of the world around them. After the 9/11 attacks, as the bureau chief in Jerusalem, I spent a lot of time in the Gaza Strip interviewing Hamas leaders, recruiters and foot soldiers, trying to understand and describe their murderous ideology. Some readers complained that I was providing a platform for terrorists, but there was never any objection from within the <i> Times </i> . (Nor did it occur to me to complain that by publishing op-eds critical of Hamas the Opinion department was putting my life in danger.) Our role, we knew, was to help readers understand such threats, and this required empathetic \u2013 not sympathetic \u2013 reporting. This is not an easy distinction but good reporters make it: they learn to understand and communicate the sources and nature of a toxic ideology without justifying it, much less advocating it. </p><p> Today\u2019s newsroom turns that moral logic on its head, at least when it comes to fellow Americans. Unlike the views of Hamas, the views of many Americans have come to seem dangerous to engage in the absence of explicit condemnation. Focusing on potential perpetrators \u2013 \u201cplatforming\u201d them by explaining rather than judging their views \u2013 is believed to empower them to do more harm. After the profile of the Ohio man was published, media Twitter lit up with attacks on the article as \u201cnormalising\u201d Nazism and white nationalism, and the <i> Times </i> convulsed internally. The <i> Times </i> wound up publishing a cringing editor\u2019s note that hung the writer out to dry and approvingly quoted some of the criticism, including a tweet from a <i> Washington Post </i> opinion editor asking, \u201cInstead of long, glowing profiles of Nazis/White nationalists, why don\u2019t we profile the victims of their ideologies\u201d? The <i> Times </i> did profile the victims of such ideologies; and the very headline of the piece \u2013 \u201cA Voice of Hate in America\u2019s Heartland\u201d \u2013 undermined the claim that it was \u201cglowing\u201d. But the <i> Times </i> lacked the confidence to defend its own work. (As it happens, being platformed did not do much to increase the power of that Ohio man. He, his wife and his brother lost their jobs and the newly married couple lost the home intended for their muffin pan.) </p><p> The editor\u2019s note paraded the principle of publishing such pieces, saying it was important to \u201cshed more light, not less, on the most extreme corners of American life\u201d. But less light is what the readers got. As a reporter in the newsroom, you\u2019d have to have been an idiot after that explosion to attempt such a profile. Empathetic reporting about Trump supporters became even more rare. It became a clich\u00e9 among influential left-wing columnists and editors that blinkered political reporters interviewed a few Trump supporters in diners and came away suckered into thinking there was something besides racism that could explain anyone\u2019s support for the man. </p><p> I failed to take the hint. As the first anniversary of Trump\u2019s inauguration approached, the editors who compile letters to the <i> Times </i> , part of my department, had put out a request to readers who supported the president to say what they thought of him now. The results had some nuance. \u201cYes, he is embarrassing,\u201d wrote one reader. \u201cYes, he picks unnecessary fights. But he also pushed tax reform through, has largely defeated <small> ISIS </small> in Iraq,\u201d and so forth. After a year spent publishing editorials attacking Trump and his policies, I thought it would be a demonstration of <i> Times </i> ian open-mindedness to give his supporters their say. Also, I thought the letters were interesting, so I turned over the entire editorial page to the Trump letters. </p><p> I wasn\u2019t surprised that we got some criticism on Twitter. But I was astonished by the fury of my <i> Times </i> colleagues. I found myself facing an angry internal town hall, trying to justify what to me was an obvious journalistic decision. During the session, one of the newsroom\u2019s journalists demanded to know when I would publish a page of letters from Barack Obama\u2019s supporters. I stammered out some kind of answer. The question just didn\u2019t make sense to me. Pretty much every day we published letters from people who supported Obama and criticised Trump. Didn\u2019t he know that Obama wasn\u2019t president any more? Didn\u2019t he think other <i> Times </i> readers should understand the sources of Trump\u2019s support? Didn\u2019t he also see it was a wonderful thing that some Trump supporters did not just dismiss the <i> Times </i> as fake news, but still believed in it enough to respond thoughtfully to an invitation to share their views? </p><p> And if the <i> Times </i> could not bear to publish the views of Americans who supported Trump, why should it be surprised that those voters would not trust it? Two years later, in 2020, Baquet acknowledged that in 2016 the <i> Times </i> had failed to take seriously the idea that Trump could become president partly because it failed to send its reporters out into America to listen to voters and understand \u201cthe turmoil in the country\u201d. And, he continued, the <i> Times </i> still did not understand the views of many Americans. \u201cOne of the great puzzles of 2016 remains a great puzzle,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy did millions and millions of Americans vote for a guy who\u2019s such an unusual candidate?\u201d Speaking four months before we published the Cotton op-ed, he said that to argue that the views of such voters should not appear in the <i> Times </i> was \u201cnot journalistic\u201d. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20231213_1843_NYT_06.jpg\"></figure><p> Conservative arguments in the Opinion pages reliably started uproars within the <i> Times </i> . Sometimes I would hear directly from colleagues who had the grace to confront me with their concerns; more often they would take to the company\u2019s Slack channels or Twitter to advertise their distress in front of each other. By contrast, in my four years as Opinion editor, I received just two complaints from newsroom staff about pieces we published from the left. When I was visiting one of the <i> Times </i> \u2019s West Coast bureaus, a reporter pulled me aside to say he worried that a liberal columnist was engaged in ad hominem attacks; a reporter in the Washington bureau wrote to me to object to an op-ed piece questioning the value of protecting free speech for right-wing groups. </p><p> This environment of enforced group-think, inside and outside the paper, was hard even on liberal opinion writers. One left-of-centre columnist told me that he was reluctant to appear in the New York office for fear of being accosted by colleagues. (An internal survey shortly after I left the paper found that barely half the staff, within an enterprise ostensibly devoted to telling the truth, agreed \u201cthere is a free exchange of views in this company\u201d and \u201cpeople are not afraid to say what they really think\u201d.) Even columnists with impeccable leftist bona fides recoiled from tackling subjects when their point of view might depart from progressive orthodoxy. I once complimented a long-time, left-leaning Opinion writer over a column criticising Democrats in Congress for doing something stupid. Trying to encourage more such journalism and thus less such stupidity, I remarked that this kind of argument had more influence than yet another Trump-is-a-devil column. \u201cI know,\u201d he replied, ruefully. \u201cBut Twitter hates it.\u201d </p><p> The bias had become so pervasive, even in the senior editing ranks of the newsroom, as to be unconscious. Trying to be helpful, one of the top newsroom editors urged me to start attaching trigger warnings to pieces by conservatives. It had not occurred to him how this would stigmatise certain colleagues, or what it would say to the world about the <i> Times </i> \u2019s own bias. By their nature, information bubbles are powerfully self-reinforcing, and I think many <i> Times </i> staff have little idea how closed their world has become, or how far they are from fulfilling their compact with readers to show the world \u201cwithout fear or favour\u201d. And sometimes the bias was explicit: one newsroom editor told me that, because I was publishing more conservatives, he felt he needed to push his own department further to the left. </p><p> The <i> Times </i> \u2019s failure to honour its own stated principles of openness to a range of views was particularly hard on the handful of conservative writers, some of whom would complain about being flyspecked and abused by colleagues. One day when I relayed a conservative\u2019s concern about double standards to Sulzberger, he lost his patience. He told me to inform the complaining conservative that that\u2019s just how it was: there was a double standard and he should get used to it. A publication that promises its readers to stand apart from politics should not have different standards for different writers based on their politics. But I delivered the message. There are many things I regret about my tenure as editorial-page editor. That is the only act of which I am ashamed. </p><p><span> A </span> s I realised how different the new <i> Times </i> had become from the old one that trained me, I began to think of myself not as a benighted veteran on a remote island, but as Rip Van Winkle. I had left one newspaper, had a pleasant dream for ten years, and returned to a place I barely recognised. The new <i> New York Times </i> was the product of two shocks \u2013 sudden collapse, and then sudden success. The paper almost went bankrupt during the financial crisis, and the ensuing panic provoked a crisis of confidence among its leaders. Digital competitors like the <i> HuffPost </i> were gaining readers and winning plaudits within the media industry as innovative. They were the cool kids; <i> Times </i> folk were ink-stained wrinklies. </p><p> In its panic, the <i> Times </i> bought out experienced reporters and editors and began hiring journalists from publications like the <i> HuffPost </i> who were considered \u201cdigital natives\u201d because they had never worked in print. This hiring quickly became easier, since most digital publications financed by venture capital turned out to be bad businesses. The advertising that was supposed to fund them flowed instead to the giant social-media companies. The <i> HuffPost </i> s and <i> Buzzfeed </i> s began to decay, and the <i> Times </i> \u2019s subscriptions and staff began to grow. </p><p> I have been lucky in my own career to move between local and national and international journalism, newspapers and magazines, opinion and news, and the print and digital realms. I was even luckier in these various roles to have editors with a profound understanding of their particular form and a sense of duty about teaching it. The wipeout of local papers and the desperate transformation of survivors like the <i> Times </i> have left young reporters today with fewer such opportunities. </p><p> Though they might have lacked deep or varied reporting backgrounds, some of the <i> Times </i> \u2019s new hires brought skills in video and audio; others were practised at marketing themselves \u2013 building their brands, as journalists now put it \u2013 in social media. Some were brilliant and fiercely honest, in keeping with the old aspirations of the paper. But, critically, the <i> Times </i> abandoned its practice of acculturation, including those months-long assignments on Metro covering cops and crime or housing. Many new hires who never spent time in the streets went straight into senior writing and editing roles. Meanwhile, the paper began pushing out its print-era salespeople and hiring new ones, and also hiring hundreds of engineers to build its digital infrastructure. All these recruits arrived with their own notions of the purpose of the <i> Times </i> . To me, publishing conservatives helped fulfil the paper\u2019s mission; to them, I think, it betrayed that mission. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20231213_1843_NYT_07.jpg\"><figcaption class=\"css-18w36g1 edweubf2\"><span> Dean Baquet, former executive editor of the <i> New York Times </i> addressing the newsroom </span></figcaption></figure><p> And then, to the shock and horror of the newsroom, Trump won the presidency. In his article for <i> Columbia Journalism Review </i> , Sulzberger cites the <i> Times </i> \u2019s failure to take Trump\u2019s chances seriously as an example of how \u201cprematurely shutting down inquiry and debate\u201d can allow \u201cconventional wisdom to ossify in a way that blinds society.\u201d Many <i> Times </i> staff members \u2013 scared, angry \u2013 assumed the <i> Times </i> was supposed to help lead the resistance. Anxious for growth, the <i> Times </i> \u2019s marketing team implicitly endorsed that idea, too. </p><p> As the number of subscribers ballooned, the marketing department tracked their expectations, and came to a nuanced conclusion. More than 95% of <i> Times </i> subscribers described themselves as Democrats or independents, and a vast majority of them believed the <i> Times </i> was also liberal. A similar majority applauded that bias; it had become \u201ca selling point\u201d, reported one internal marketing memo. Yet at the same time, the marketers concluded, subscribers wanted to believe that the <i> Times </i> was independent. </p><p> When you think about it, this contradiction resolves itself easily. It is human nature to want to see your bias confirmed; however, it is also human nature to want to be reassured that your bias is not just a bias, but is endorsed by journalism that is \u201cfair and balanced\u201d, as a certain Murdoch-owned cable-news network used to put it. As that memo argued, even if the <i> Times </i> was seen as politically to the left, it was critical to its brand also to be seen as broadening its readers\u2019 horizons, and that required \u201ca perception of independence\u201d. </p><p> Perception is one thing, and actual independence another. Readers could cancel their subscriptions if the <i> Times </i> challenged their worldview by reporting the truth without regard to politics. As a result, the <i> Times </i> \u2019s long-term civic value was coming into conflict with the paper\u2019s short-term shareholder value. As the cable networks have shown, you can build a decent business by appealing to the millions of Americans who comprise one of the partisan tribes of the electorate. The <i> Times </i> has every right to pursue the commercial strategy that makes it the most money. But leaning into a partisan audience creates a powerful dynamic. Nobody warned the new subscribers to the <i> Times </i> that it might disappoint them by reporting truths that conflicted with their expectations. When your product is \u201cindependent journalism\u201d, that commercial strategy is tricky, because too much independence might alienate your audience, while too little can lead to charges of hypocrisy that strike at the heart of the brand. </p><p> It became one of Dean Baquet\u2019s frequent mordant jokes that he missed the old advertising-based business model, because, compared with subscribers, advertisers felt so much less sense of ownership over the journalism. I recall his astonishment, fairly early in the Trump administration, after <i> Times </i> reporters conducted an interview with Trump. Subscribers were angry about the questions the <i> Times </i> had asked. It was as if they\u2019d only be satisfied, Baquet said, if the reporters leaped across the desk and tried to wring the president\u2019s neck. The <i> Times </i> was slow to break it to its readers that there was less to Trump\u2019s ties to Russia than they were hoping, and more to Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop, that Trump might be right that covid came from a Chinese lab, that masks were not always effective against the virus, that shutting down schools for many months was a bad idea. </p><p> In my experience, reporters overwhelmingly support Democratic policies and candidates. They are generally also motivated by a desire for a more just world. Neither of those tendencies are new. But there has been a sea change over the past ten years in how journalists think about pursuing justice. The reporters\u2019 creed used to have its foundation in liberalism, in the classic philosophical sense. The exercise of a reporter\u2019s curiosity and empathy, given scope by the constitutional protections of free speech, would equip readers with the best information to form their own judgments. The best ideas and arguments would win out. The journalist\u2019s role was to be a sworn witness; the readers\u2019 role was to be judge and jury. In its idealised form, journalism was lonely, prickly, unpopular work, because it was only through unrelenting scepticism and questioning that society could advance. If everyone the reporter knew thought X, the reporter\u2019s role was to ask: why X? </p><p> Illiberal journalists have a different philosophy, and they have their reasons for it. They are more concerned with group rights than individual rights, which they regard as a bulwark for the privileges of white men. They have seen the principle of free speech used to protect right-wing outfits like <i> Project Veritas </i> and <i> Breitbart News </i> and are uneasy with it. They had their suspicions of their fellow citizens\u2019 judgment confirmed by Trump\u2019s election, and do not believe readers can be trusted with potentially dangerous ideas or facts. They are not out to achieve social justice as the knock-on effect of pursuing truth; they want to pursue it head-on. The term \u201cobjectivity\u201d to them is code for ignoring the poor and weak and cosying up to power, as journalists often have done. </p><p> And they do not just want to be part of the cool crowd. They need to be. To be more valued by their peers and their contacts \u2013 and hold sway over their bosses \u2013 they need a lot of followers in social media. That means they must be seen to applaud the right sentiments of the right people in social media. The journalist from central casting used to be a loner, contrarian or a misfit. Now journalism is becoming another job for joiners, or, to borrow Twitter\u2019s own parlance, \u201cfollowers\u201d, a term that mocks the essence of a journalist\u2019s role. </p><p> This is a bit of a paradox. The new newsroom ideology seems idealistic, yet it has grown from cynical roots in academia: from the idea that there is no such thing as objective truth; that there is only narrative, and that therefore whoever controls the narrative \u2013 whoever gets to tell the version of the story that the public hears \u2013 has the whip hand. What matters, in other words, is not truth and ideas in themselves, but the power to determine both in the public mind. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20231213_1843_NYT_08.jpg\"></figure><p> By contrast, the old newsroom ideology seems cynical on its surface. It used to bug me that my editors at the <i> Times </i> assumed every word out of the mouth of any person in power was a lie. And the pursuit of objectivity can seem reptilian, even nihilistic, in its abjuration of a fixed position in moral contests. But the basis of that old newsroom approach was idealistic: the notion that power ultimately lies in truth and ideas, and that the citizens of a pluralistic democracy, not leaders of any sort, must be trusted to judge both. </p><p> Our role in <i> Times </i> Opinion, I used to urge my colleagues, was not to tell people what to think, but to help them fulfil their desire to think for themselves. It seems to me that putting the pursuit of truth, rather than of justice, at the top of a publication\u2019s hierarchy of values also better serves not just truth but justice, too: over the long term journalism that is not also sceptical of the advocates of any form of justice and the programmes they put forward, and that does not struggle honestly to understand and explain the sources of resistance, will not assure that those programmes will work, and it also has no legitimate claim to the trust of reasonable people who see the world very differently. Rather than advance understanding and durable change, it provokes backlash. </p><p> The impatience within the newsroom with such old ways was intensified by the generational failure of the <i> Times </i> to hire and promote women and non-white people, black people in particular. In the 1990s, and into the early part of this century, when I worked in the high-profile Washington bureau of the <i> Times </i> , usually at most two of the dozens of journalists stationed there were black. Before Baquet became executive editor, the highest-ranked black journalist at the <i> Times </i> had been my old Metro editor, Gerald Boyd. He rose to become managing editor before A.G. Sulzberger\u2019s father pushed him out, along with the executive editor, Howell Raines, when a black reporter named Jayson Blair was discovered to be a fabulist. Boyd was said to have protected Blair, an accusation he denied and attributed to racism. </p><p> The accusation against Boyd never made sense to me. In my experience he was even harder on black and brown reporters than he was on us white people. He understood better than anyone what it would take for them to succeed at the <i> Times </i> . \u201cThe <i> Times </i> was a place where blacks felt they had to convince their white peers that they were good enough to be there,\u201d he wrote in his heartbreaking memoir, published posthumously. He died in 2006 of lung cancer, three years after he was discarded. </p><p> Pay attention if you are white at the <i> Times </i> and you will hear black editors speak of hiring consultants at their own expense to figure out how to get white staff to respect them. You might hear how a black journalist, passing through the newsroom, was asked by a white colleague whether he was the \u201ctelephone guy\u201d sent to fix his extension. I certainly never got asked a question like that. Among the experienced journalists at the <i> Times </i> , black journalists were least likely, I thought, to exhibit fragility and herd behaviour. </p><p> As wave after wave of pain and outrage swept through the <i> Times </i> , over a headline that was not damning enough of Trump or someone\u2019s obnoxious tweets, I came to think of the people who were fragile, the ones who were caught up in Slack or Twitter storms, as people who had only recently discovered that they were white and were still getting over the shock. Having concluded they had got ahead by working hard, it has been a revelation to them that their skin colour was not just part of the wallpaper of American life, but a source of power, protection and advancement. They may know a lot about television, or real estate, or how to edit audio files, but their work does not take them into shelters, or police precincts, or the homes of people who see the world very differently. It has never exposed them to live fire. Their idea of violence includes vocabulary. </p><p> I share the bewilderment that so many people could back Trump, given the things he says and does, and that makes me want to understand why they do: the breadth and diversity of his support suggests not just racism is at work. Yet these elite, well-meaning <i> Times </i> staff cannot seem to stretch the empathy they are learning to extend to people with a different skin colour to include those, of whatever race, who have different politics. </p><p> The digital natives were nevertheless valuable, not only for their skills but also because they were excited for the <i> Times </i> to embrace its future. That made them important allies of the editorial and business leaders as they sought to shift the <i> Times </i> to digital journalism and to replace staff steeped in the ways of print. Partly for that reason, and partly out of fear, the leadership indulged internal attacks on <i> Times </i> journalism, despite pleas from me and others, to them and the company as a whole, that <i> Times </i> folk should treat each other with more respect. My colleagues and I in Opinion came in for a lot of the scorn, but we were not alone. Correspondents in the Washington bureau and political reporters would take a beating, too, when they were seen as committing sins like \u201cfalse balance\u201d because of the nuance in their stories. </p><p> My fellow editorial and commercial leaders were well aware of how the culture of the institution had changed. As delighted as they were by the <i> Times </i> \u2019s digital transformation they were not blind to the ideological change that came with it. They were unhappy with the bullying and group-think; we often discussed such cultural problems in the weekly meetings of the executive committee, composed of the top editorial and business leaders, including the publisher. Inevitably, these bitch sessions would end with someone saying a version of: \u201cWell, at some point we have to tell them this is what we believe in as a newspaper, and if they don\u2019t like it they should work somewhere else.\u201d It took me a couple of years to realise that this moment was never going to come. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20231213_1843_NYT_09.jpg\"><figcaption class=\"css-18w36g1 edweubf2\"><span> Arthur Sulzberger, former publisher of the <i> New York Times </i> ( <i> left </i> ) with his son A.G. Sulzberger at the <i> Times </i> building in 2017 </span></figcaption></figure><p> More than 30 years ago, a young political reporter named Todd Purdum tremulously asked an all-staff meeting what would be done about the \u201cclimate of fear\u201d within the newsroom in which reporters felt intimidated by their bosses? The moment immediately entered <i> Times </i> lore. There is a lot not to miss about the days when editors like Boyd could strike terror in young reporters like me and Purdum. But the pendulum has swung so far in the other direction that editors now tremble before their reporters and even their interns. \u201cI miss the old climate of fear,\u201d Baquet used to say with a smile, in another of his barbed jokes. </p><p><span> D </span> uring the first meeting of the <i> Times </i> board of directors that I attended, in 2016, Baquet and I hosted a joint question-and-answer session. At one point, Baquet, musing about how the <i> Times </i> was changing, observed that one of the newsroom\u2019s cultural critics had become the paper\u2019s best political-opinion columnist. Taking this musing one step further, I then noted that this raised an obvious question: why did the paper still have an Opinion department separate from the newsroom, with its own editor reporting directly to the publisher? If the newsroom was publishing the best opinion journalism at the paper \u2013 if it was publishing opinion at all \u2013 why did the <i> Times </i> maintain a separate department that falsely claimed to have a monopoly on such journalism? </p><p> Everyone laughed. But I meant it, and I wish I\u2019d pursued my point and talked myself out of the job. This contest over control of opinion journalism within the <i> Times </i> was not just a bureaucratic turf battle (though it was that, too). The newsroom\u2019s embrace of opinion journalism has compromised the <i> Times </i> \u2019s independence, misled its readers and fostered a culture of intolerance and conformity. </p><p> The Opinion department is a relic of the era when the <i> Times </i> enforced a line between news and opinion journalism. Editors in the newsroom did not touch opinionated copy, lest they be contaminated by it, and opinion journalists and editors kept largely to their own, distant floor within the <i> Times </i> building. Such fastidiousness could seem excessive, but it enforced an ethos that <i> Times </i> reporters owed their readers an unceasing struggle against bias in the news. But by the time I returned as editorial-page editor, more opinion columnists and critics were writing for the newsroom than for Opinion. As at the cable news networks, the boundaries between commentary and news were disappearing, and readers had little reason to trust that <i> Times </i> journalists were resisting rather than indulging their biases. </p><p> The <i> Times </i> newsroom had added more cultural critics, and, as Baquet noted, they were free to opine about politics. Departments across the <i> Times </i> newsroom had also begun appointing their own \u201ccolumnists\u201d, without stipulating any rules that might distinguish them from columnists in Opinion. It became a running joke. Every few months, some poor editor in the newsroom or Opinion would be tasked with writing up guidelines that would distinguish the newsroom\u2019s opinion journalists from those of Opinion, and every time they would ultimately throw up their hands. </p><p> I remember how shaken A.G. Sulzberger was one day when he was cornered by a cultural critic who had got wind that such guardrails might be put in place. The critic insisted he was an opinion writer, just like anyone in the Opinion department, and he would not be reined in. He wasn\u2019t. (I checked to see if, since I left the <i> Times </i> , it had developed guidelines explaining the difference, if any, between a news columnist and opinion columnist. The paper\u2019s spokeswoman, Danielle Rhoades Ha, did not respond to the question.) </p><p> The internet rewards opinionated work and, as news editors felt increasing pressure to generate page views, they began not just hiring more opinion writers but also running their own versions of opinionated essays by outside voices \u2013 historically, the province of Opinion\u2019s op-ed department. Yet because the paper continued to honour the letter of its old principles, none of this work could be labelled \u201copinion\u201d (it still isn\u2019t). After all, it did not come from the Opinion department. And so a newsroom technology columnist might call for, say, unionisation of the Silicon Valley workforce, as one did, or an outside writer might argue in the business section for reparations for slavery, as one did, and to the average reader their work would appear indistinguishable from <i> Times </i> news articles. </p><p> By similarly circular logic, the newsroom\u2019s opinion journalism breaks another of the <i> Times </i> \u2019s commitments to its readers. Because the newsroom officially does not do opinion \u2013 even though it openly hires and publishes opinion journalists \u2013 it feels free to ignore Opinion\u2019s mandate to provide a diversity of views. When I was editorial-page editor, there were a couple of newsroom columnists whose politics were not obvious. But the other newsroom columnists, and the critics, read as passionate progressives. </p><p> I urged Baquet several times to add a conservative to the newsroom roster of cultural critics. That would serve the readers by diversifying the <i> Times </i> \u2019s analysis of culture, where the paper\u2019s left-wing bias had become most blatant, and it would show that the newsroom also believed in restoring the <i> Times </i> \u2019s commitment to taking conservatives seriously. He said this was a good idea, but he never acted on it. I couldn\u2019t help trying the idea out on one of the paper\u2019s top cultural editors, too: he told me he did not think <i> Times </i> readers would be interested in that point of view. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20231213_1843_NYT_10.jpg\"></figure><p> As the <i> Times </i> tried to compete for more readers online, homogenous opinion was spreading through the newsroom in other ways. News desks were urging reporters to write in the first person and to use more \u201cvoice\u201d, but few newsroom editors had experience in handling that kind of journalism, and no one seemed certain where \u201cvoice\u201d stopped and \u201copinion\u201d began. The <i> Times </i> magazine, meanwhile, became a crusading progressive publication. Baquet liked to say the magazine was Switzerland, by which he meant that it sat between the newsroom and Opinion. But it reported only to the news side. Its work was not labelled as opinion and it was free to omit conservative viewpoints. </p><p> This creep of politics into the newsroom\u2019s journalism helped the <i> Times </i> beat back some of its new challengers, at least those on the left. Competitors like <i> Vox </i> and the <i> HuffPost </i> were blending leftish politics with reporting and writing it up conversationally in the first person. Imitating their approach, along with hiring some of their staff, helped the <i> Times </i> repel them. But it came at a cost. The rise of opinion journalism over the past 15 years changed the newsroom\u2019s coverage and its culture. The tiny redoubt of never-Trump conservatives in Opinion is swamped daily not only by the many progressives in that department but their reinforcements among the critics, columnists and magazine writers in the newsroom. They are generally excellent, but their homogeneity means <i> Times </i> readers are being served a very restricted range of views, some of them presented as straight news by a publication that still holds itself out as independent of any politics. And because the critics, newsroom columnists and magazine writers are the newsroom\u2019s most celebrated journalists, they have disproportionate influence over the paper\u2019s culture. </p><p> And yet the <i> Times </i> insists to the public that nothing has changed. By saying that it still holds itself to the old standard of strictly separating its news and opinion journalists, the paper leads its readers further into the trap of thinking that what they are reading is independent and impartial \u2013 and this misleads them about their country\u2019s centre of political and cultural gravity. \u201cEven though each day\u2019s opinion pieces are typically among our most popular journalism and our columnists are among our most trusted voices, we believe opinion is secondary to our primary mission of reporting and should represent only a portion of a healthy news diet,\u201d Sulzberger wrote in the <i> Columbia Journalism Review. </i> \u201cFor that reason, we\u2019ve long kept the Opinion department intentionally small \u2013 it represents well under a tenth of our journalistic staff \u2013 and ensured that its editorial decision-making is walled off from the newsroom.\u201d </p><p> When I was editorial-page editor, Sulzberger, who declined to be interviewed on the record for this article, worried a great deal about the breakdown in the boundaries between news and opinion. At one town hall, he was confronted by a staffer upset that we in Opinion had begun doing more original reporting, which was a priority for me. Sulzberger replied he was much less worried about reporting in the Opinion coverage than by opinion in the news report \u2013 a fine moment, I thought then and think now, in his leadership. He told me once that he would like to restructure the paper to have one editor oversee all its news reporters, another all its opinion journalists and a third all its service journalists, the ones who supply guidance on buying gizmos or travelling abroad. Each of these editors would report to him. That is the kind of action the <i> Times </i> needs to take now to confront its hypocrisy and begin restoring its independence. </p><p> The <i> Times </i> could learn something from the <i> Wall Street Journal </i> , which has kept its journalistic poise. It has maintained a stricter separation between its news and opinion journalism, including its cultural criticism, and that has protected the integrity of its work. After I was chased out of the <i> Times </i> , <i> Journal </i> reporters and other staff attempted a similar assault on their opinion department. Some 280 of them signed a letter listing pieces they found offensive and demanding changes in how their opinion colleagues approached their work. \u201cTheir anxieties aren\u2019t our responsibility,\u201d shrugged the <i> Journal </i> \u2019s editorial board in a note to readers after the letter was leaked. \u201cThe signers report to the news editors or other parts of the business.\u201d The editorial added, in case anyone missed the point, \u201cWe are not the <i> New York Times </i> .\u201d That was the end of it. </p><p> Unlike the publishers of the <i> Journal </i> , however, Sulzberger is in a bind, or at least perceives himself to be. The confusion within the <i> Times </i> over its role, and the rising tide of intolerance among the reporters, the engineers, the business staff, even the subscribers \u2013 these are all problems he inherited, in more ways than one. He seems to feel constrained in confronting the paper\u2019s illiberalism by the very source of his authority. He is sensitive about the idiosyncratic way he reached the pinnacle of American news media, via his family\u2019s control of the paper\u2019s voting stock. Once, when I told him we were preparing an editorial series on nepotism within the Trump White House, he was quick to note that the <i> Times </i> was in a glass house when it came to such criticism. </p><p> The paradox is that in previous generations the Sulzbergers\u2019 control was the bulwark of the paper\u2019s independence. For this publisher, it seems also to be a vulnerability. He noted in the <i> Columbia Journalism Review </i> that he is \u201ca wealthy white man who succeeded a series of other wealthy white men with the same first and last name.\u201d His background, he wrote, may make him \u201cuniquely, perhaps even comically, unpersuasive\u201d in the debate over journalistic principles. That confession read like throat-clearing before his lengthy exposition of \u201cindependent journalism\u201d, and it is right for people to be aware of the blinders and biases created by their upbringing. But if he is going to instil the principles he believes in, he needs to stop worrying so much about his powers of persuasion, and start using the power he is so lucky to have. </p><p><span> T </span> om Cotton had written two op-eds for us in Opinion, making the case for buying Greenland and defending Trump\u2019s decision to assassinate the head of the Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, General Qassem Suleimani. Adam Rubenstein, a rising talent in Opinion, had helped edit the second of these pieces. Rubenstein had brought in dozens of op-eds by then that reflected a variety of voices, ideas and politics, and had received a note of praise from Sulzberger himself, for a piece by a former congressman, Joe Walsh, a Tea Party favourite who had called for a primary challenge to Trump. But Rubenstein had a background in conservative journalism, and within the <i> Times </i> his work in soliciting pieces from conservatives had put a target on his back. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20231213_1843_NYT_11.jpg\"><figcaption class=\"css-18w36g1 edweubf2\"><span> Donald Trump with Cotton ( <i> left </i> ) speaking at the White House in 2017 </span></figcaption></figure><p> In early June 2020 Cotton\u2019s office pitched a piece about Twitter\u2019s curation of its platform. Cotton had tweeted that Trump should call out troops to stop the \u201canarchy, rioting and looting\u201d if \u201clocal law enforcement is overwhelmed\u201d, and Twitter had threatened to censor his account. Jim Dao, the op-ed editor, was more interested in the substance of the tweet and, via Rubenstein, asked Cotton to write an op-ed about that. </p><p> That was the right thing to do. Trump was starting to call for the use of troops, and on May 31st the mayor of Washington, DC, had requested that the National Guard be deployed in her city. After police gassed protesters before Trump posed for a photo in Lafayette Square on June 1st, the editorial board, which I led, weighed in against that use of force and Trump\u2019s \u201cincendiary behaviour\u201d, and the op-ed team had pieces planned for June 3rd arguing he did not have a sound basis to call out federal forces and would be wrong to do so. In keeping with the basic practice of the op-ed page, which was created to present points of view at odds with <i> Times </i> editorials, Dao owed readers the counter-argument. They also needed to know someone so influential with the president was making this argument, and how he was making it. </p><p> I knew the piece was coming, and that Dao had asked for substantive revisions to the first draft. At the time, Rubenstein was assisting me with research for a daily newsletter I was writing, and I asked him when we met on the morning of June 3rd to make sure Cotton was distinguishing clearly between rioters and protesters. He did: \u201cA majority who seek to protest peacefully shouldn\u2019t be confused with bands of miscreants,\u201d Cotton wrote. From Cotton\u2019s perspective, it was leftist elites who were confusing the two. In the op-ed, he decried any \u201crevolting moral equivalence of rioters and looters to peaceful, law-abiding protesters\u201d. </p><p> Rubenstein also told me that in one draft Cotton had linked disapprovingly to a tweet from a <i> Times </i> reporter that could be read as expressing support for the rioters. I told Rubenstein to make sure that this link was removed. I had prohibited criticising any work, including any social-media activity, from the newsroom, unless I ran the idea by a senior newsroom editor first. </p><p> Shortly after we published the op-ed that Wednesday afternoon, some reporters tweeted their opposition to Cotton\u2019s argument. But the real action was in the <i> Times </i> \u2019s Slack channels, where reporters and other staff began not just venting but organising. They turned to the union to draw up a workplace complaint about the op-ed. At least one of the reporters who covered news media took a strong position in this internal debate: \u201cAmplifying a message that argues for MORE force only puts our own people in harm\u2019s way, and undermines the paper\u2019s commitment to their safety,\u201d this reporter argued to colleagues in Slack, going on to offer suggestions for how the union should attack the op-ed: \u201cI think it\u2019s good that a lot of us will put our names on a strong condemnation.\u201d </p><p> The next day, this reporter shared the byline on the <i> Times </i> story about the op-ed. That article did not mention that Cotton had distinguished between \u201cpeaceful, law-abiding protesters\u201d and \u201crioters and looters\u201d. In fact, the first sentence reported that Cotton had called for \u201cthe military to suppress protests against police violence\u201d. </p><p> This was \u2013 and is \u2013 wrong. You don\u2019t have to take my word for that. You can take the <i> Times </i> \u2019s. Three days later in its article on my resignation it also initially reported that Cotton had called \u201cfor military force against protesters in American cities\u201d. This time, after the article was published on the <i> Times </i> website, the editors scrambled to rewrite it, replacing \u201cmilitary force\u201d with \u201cmilitary response\u201d and \u201cprotesters\u201d with \u201ccivic unrest\u201d. That was a weaselly adjustment \u2013 Cotton wrote about criminality, not \u201cunrest\u201d \u2013 but the article at least no longer unambiguously misrepresented Cotton\u2019s argument to make it seem he was in favour of crushing democratic protest. The <i> Times </i> did not publish a correction or any note acknowledging the story had been changed. </p><p> Seeking to influence the outcome of a story you cover, particularly without disclosing that to the reader, violates basic principles I was raised on at the <i> Times </i> . I asked the <i> Times </i> if the media reporter\u2019s behaviour was ethical. The spokeswoman, Ms Rhoades Ha, did not answer the question but instead wrote in an email that the reporter was assigned to the story after posting the messages in Slack and the \u201ceditors were unaware of those Slack messages\u201d. The reporter, apparently asked by the <i> Times </i> to write to me, immediately followed with an email that said: \u201cIn the heat of the moment, I made comments on an internal Slack channel that, as a media reporter, I should not have\u201d but that \u201cthe factual reporting I contributed to the story is not at issue.\u201d (I am not naming this journalist because I do not want to point the finger at a single reporter when, in my view, an editor should be taking responsibility for the coverage.) Ms Rhoades Ha disputes my characterisation of the after-the-fact editing of the story about my resignation. She said the editors changed the story after it was published on the website in order to \u201crefine\u201d it and \u201cadd context\u201d, and so the story did not merit a correction disclosing to the reader that changes had been made. </p><p> I asked if it was accurate and fair to report that Cotton called for \u201cthe military to suppress protests against police violence\u201d, as the June 4th story still does. In response, Ms Rhoades Ha supplied an opinion from a <i> Times </i> lawyer which noted that Cotton called for a military presence to \u201cdeter lawbreakers\u201d. The lawyer argued that because some protesters violated curfews, failed to get permits or disperse when police ordered them to, they could be considered \u201clawbreakers\u201d, just like the rioters and looters Cotton explicitly referred to. I followed up, saying I was seeking an editorial rather than a legal opinion, and asking again whether the <i> Times </i> believed its characterisation of Cotton\u2019s argument was not just accurate, but fair. Ms Rhoades Ha again referred me to the lawyer\u2019s opinion. </p><p> She also defended the <i> Times </i> more broadly: \u201cThe <i> New York Times </i> believes unequivocally in the principle of independence, as has been demonstrated consistently by our journalism before and since that episode. There are countless examples of the <i> Times </i> standing strong against pressure and protest, whether from governments, companies, politicians, activist groups or even internally. In the case of the Tom Cotton op-ed, the handling of such a sensitive piece, specifically the decision to rush it into publication without key leaders having read it because it was \u201cnewsy\u201d, made it unusually vulnerable to attack. Good principles, as the Cotton op-ed demonstrated, cannot be an excuse for bad execution.\u201d </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20231213_1843_NYT_12.jpg\"><figcaption class=\"css-18w36g1 edweubf2\"><span> A man smashing a cash register following the death of George Floyd in 2020 </span></figcaption></figure><p> In retrospect what seems almost comical is that as the conflict over Cotton\u2019s op-ed unfolded within the <i> Times </i> I acted as though it was on the level, as though the staff of the <i> Times </i> would have a good-faith debate about Cotton\u2019s piece and the decision to publish it. Instead, people wanted to vent and achieve what they considered to be justice, whether through Twitter, Slack, the union or the news pages themselves. Engaging with them at all was a mistake. That first night after the op-ed was published, when I called Baquet, his sage advice was to say nothing. Give it time, he said. Let this play out. The publisher disagreed. He thought we needed to say something that night explaining why we chose to publish the piece, and so we kept heaping more logs on the fire. </p><p> My colleagues in Opinion, together with the <small> PR </small> team, put together a series of connected tweets describing the purpose behind publishing Cotton\u2019s op-ed. Rather than publish these tweets from the generic <i> Times </i> Opinion Twitter account, Sulzberger encouraged me to do it from my personal one, on the theory that this would humanise our defence. I doubted that would make any difference, but it was certainly my job to take responsibility. So I sent out the tweets, sticking my head in a Twitter bucket that clangs, occasionally, to this day. At the publisher\u2019s direction, I then wrote an explanation of the decision to publish the op-ed for the next day\u2019s edition of the Opinion newsletter. Reading that piece now, I think it holds up. It was not defensive and it dealt with the strongest criticisms. It concluded with a sentiment that I\u2019ve always thought journalists should bring to all their work, and which I intended as an invitation to debate. (\u201cIt is impossible to feel righteous about any of this. I know that my own view may be wrong.\u201d) But no one took me up on that. </p><p><span> W </span> hat is worth recalling now from the bedlam of the next two days? I suppose there might be lessons for someone interested in how not to manage a corporate crisis. I began making my own mistakes that Thursday. The union condemned our publication of Cotton, for supposedly putting journalists in danger, claiming that he had called on the military \u201cto \u2018detain\u2019 and \u2018subdue\u2019 Americans protesting racism and police brutality\u201d \u2013 again, a misrepresentation of his argument. The publisher called to tell me the company was experiencing its largest sick day in history; people were turning down job offers because of the op-ed, and, he said, some people were quitting. He had been expecting for some time that the union would seek a voice in editorial decision-making; he said he thought this was the moment the union was making its move. He had clearly changed his own mind about the value of publishing the Cotton op-ed. </p><p> I asked Dao to have our fact-checkers review the union\u2019s claims. But then I went a step further: at the publisher\u2019s request, I urged him to review the editing of the piece itself and come back to me with a list of steps we could have taken to make it better. Dao\u2019s reflex \u2013 the correct one \u2013 was to defend the piece as published. He and three other editors of varying ages, genders and races had helped edit it; it had been fact-checked, as is all our work. But I resisted, worried that we had put Sulzberger in a hard position. In Opinion we had grown accustomed to the wrath of our colleagues, but this time the publisher was in the line of fire as well. </p><p> I told myself there was nothing false about this. There isn\u2019t an article out of the many thousands I have written or edited that I do not think, in retrospect, could have met a higher standard in some way \u2013 and Cotton\u2019s op-ed is no exception. And I thought that by saying we could have somehow made the piece better, we would dispel the heat within the <i> Times </i> but affirm the principle that it was the kind of piece we should publish. This was my last failed attempt to have the debate within the <i> Times </i> that I had been seeking for four years, about why it was important to present <i> Times </i> readers with arguments like Cotton\u2019s. The staff at the paper never wanted to have that debate. The Cotton uproar was the most extreme version of the internal reaction we faced whenever we published conservative arguments that were not simply anti-Trump. Yes, yes, of course we believe in the principle of publishing diverse views, my <i> Times </i> colleagues would say, but why <i> this </i> conservative? Why <i> this </i> argument? </p><p> Most of the union\u2019s assertions were wrong, but in going back over the piece the fact-checker did find a minor error. Cotton had accidentally left some words from a legal opinion in quotation marks that he should have put in his own voice. Dao also dutifully itemised language that we might have softened, and said the headline, \u201cSend in the Troops\u201d should in retrospect have been made more palatable, if duller. I doubt these changes would have mattered, and to extract this list from Dao was to engage in precisely the hypocrisy I claimed to despise \u2013 that, in fact, I do despise. If Cotton needed to be held to such standards of politesse, so did everyone else. Headlines such as \u201cTom Cotton\u2019s Fascist Op-ed\u201d, the headline of a subsequent piece, should also have been tranquillised. </p><p> As that miserable Thursday wore on, Sulzberger, Baquet and I held a series of Zoom meetings with reporters and editors from the newsroom who wanted to discuss the op-ed. Though a handful of the participants were there to posture, these were generally constructive conversations. A couple of people, including Baquet, even had the guts to speak up in favour of publishing the op-ed. Two moments stick out. At one point, in answer to a question, Sulzberger and Baquet both said they thought the op-ed \u2013 as the <i> Times </i> union and many journalists were saying \u2013 had in fact put journalists in danger. That was the first time I realised I might be coming to the end of the road. The other was when a pop-culture reporter asked if I had read the op-ed before it was published. I said I had not. He immediately put his head down and started typing, and I should have paid attention rather than moving on to the next question. He was evidently sharing the news with the company over Slack. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20231213_1843_NYT_13.jpg\"><figcaption class=\"css-18w36g1 edweubf2\"><span> Baquet ( <i> second left </i> ) and Bennet ( <i> third left </i> ) applauding a Pulitzer-prize winner from the <i> Times </i> in 2019 </span></figcaption></figure><p> If he had followed up, or I had, I might have explained that this was standard practice. Dao\u2019s name was on the masthead of the <i> New York Times </i> because he was in charge of the op-ed section. If I insisted on reviewing every piece, I would have been doing his job for him \u2013 and been betraying a crippling lack of trust in one of the papers\u2019 finest editors. After I departed, and other Opinion staff quit or were reassigned, the <i> Times </i> later made him Metro editor, a sign of its own continued confidence in him. Every job review I had at the <i> Times </i> urged me to step back from the daily coverage to focus on the long term. (Hilariously, one review, urging me to move faster in upending the Opinion department, instructed me to take risks and \u201cask for forgiveness not permission\u201d.) </p><p> It was important to me to read pieces in advance that might cause an uproar, and I had asked Dao and his deputy to alert me to any they thought would be particularly sensitive, but they did not think the Cotton piece rose to that level. I had also instituted an \u201cif-you-see-something-say-something\u201d policy in Opinion as a whole. Nobody raised a red flag with me. To be clear \u2013 I don\u2019t fault anyone for this; I mention it only as an index of how much easier it was to judge in hindsight, after publication, when a piece was explosive. In any event, if anyone had raised an alarm, I might have edited the piece differently, but that would not have changed the outcome. Given the pieces we had already published and planned to publish opposing the position Cotton argued, we would still have published it \u2013 it was, in my view at the time, the kind of viewpoint the Sulzbergers had said they wanted to see also represented in the <i> Times </i> . And the critics would hardly have been mollified had it been more persuasive. </p><p> I learned when these meetings were over that there had been a new eruption in Slack. <i> Times </i> staff were saying that Rubenstein had been the sole editor of the op-ed. In response, Dao had gone into Slack to clarify to the entire company that he had also edited it himself. But when the <i> Times </i> posted the news article that evening, it reported, \u201cThe Op-Ed was edited by Adam Rubenstein\u201d and made no mention of Dao\u2019s statement. One of the ironies of this episode was that it was not any newsroom reporter but Rubenstein who wound up receiving death threats because of the Cotton op-ed, and it was the newsroom that put him in harm\u2019s way. I would put <i> Times </i> Opinion\u2019s standards for the editing of Cotton\u2019s op-ed up against the <i> Times </i> newsroom\u2019s standards for its coverage of the op-ed any day of the week. </p><p> By unhappy \u2013 but, really, also quite funny \u2013 coincidence, a meeting of the entire company had been scheduled over Zoom for the next morning. The plan had been for the newsroom to talk about its coverage of the protests. Now the only subject was going to be the op-ed. Early that morning, I got an email from Sam Dolnick, a Sulzberger cousin and a top editor at the paper, who said he felt \u201cwe\u201d \u2013 he could have only meant me \u2013 owed the whole staff \u201can apology for appearing to place an abstract idea like open debate over the value of our colleagues\u2019 lives, and their safety\u201d. He was worried that I and my colleagues had unintentionally sent a message to other people at the <i> Times </i> that: \u201cWe don\u2019t care about their full humanity and their security as much as we care about our ideas.\u201d </p><p> Like his cousin, the publisher, Dolnick is a smart guy with a good heart, and I know he meant well. But I was staggered by his email, by how different his conception was of the role of journalism, and of my own commitment to it. Did he really think I saw this as an academic exercise, or some kind of game? My mother survived the Holocaust in Poland, and it took years for her and the remnant of our family to be admitted to the United States. Did he really think I believed ideas had no consequences for people\u2019s lives? I guess I was also fed up. I wrote to the publisher, who had been copied in on Dolnick\u2019s note. </p><p> \u201cI know you don\u2019t like it when I talk about principles at a moment like this,\u201d I began. But I viewed the journalism I had been doing, at the <i> Times </i> and before that at the <i> Atlantic </i> , in very different terms from the ones Dolnick presumed. \u201cI don\u2019t think of our work as an abstraction without meaning for people\u2019s lives \u2013 quite the opposite,\u201d I continued. \u201cThe whole point \u2013 the reason I do this \u2013 is to have an impact on their lives to the good. I have always believed that putting ideas, including potentially dangerous one[s], out in the public is vital to ensuring they are debated and, if dangerous, discarded.\u201d It was, I argued, in \u201cedge cases like this that principles are tested\u201d, and if my position was judged wrong then \u201cI am out of step with the times.\u201d But, I concluded, \u201cI don\u2019t think of us as some kind of debating society without implications for the real world and I\u2019ve never been unmindful of my colleagues\u2019 humanity.\u201d </p><p> Sulzberger did not reply. But in the end, one thing he and I surely agree on is that I was, in fact, out of step with the <i> Times </i> . It may have raised me as a journalist \u2013 and invested so much in educating me to what were once its standards \u2013 but I did not belong there any more. </p><p> In retrospect, it seems clear that I was done by then. The executive committee gathered that morning to prepare, and for the first time I was not invited to join them. They had solicited questions in advance, and I got a glimpse at the list only as the company-wide meeting was about to start. I did not hear from Sulzberger, but the speechwriter who drafted many of his remarks, Alex Levy, contacted me just before the meeting began to tell me to use whatever question I got first to apologise, and at some point to acknowledge my privilege. </p><p> A Zoom call with a couple of thousand people is a disorienting experience, particularly when many of them are not particularly mindful of your \u201cfull humanity\u201d. I do not recommend it. As my first turn to speak came up, I was still struggling with what I should apologise for. I was not going to apologise for denying my colleagues\u2019 humanity or endangering their lives. I had not done those things. I was not going to apologise for publishing the op-ed. Finally, I came up with something that felt true. I told the meeting that I was sorry for the pain that my leadership of Opinion had caused. What a pathetic thing to say. I did not think to add, because I\u2019d lost track of this truth myself by then, that opinion journalism that never causes pain is not journalism. It can\u2019t hope to move society forward. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20231213_1843_NYT_15.jpg\"><figcaption class=\"css-18w36g1 edweubf2\"><span> A Black Lives Matter protest in New York, four days after George Floyd\u2019s death, on May 15th 2020 </span></figcaption></figure><p> Baquet spoke movingly about how, as a black man, he was vulnerable in ways a white man was not when he left his apartment wearing a hoodie and a mask, to ward off covid. Speaking into the void, via the unblinking eye above my computer screen, I said I knew, as a white man, I was in a very different position. When I stepped out into the street, I was protected by my privilege. But I added that I did know what it was like to be a reporter out in the field, alone, surrounded by armed, hostile people. I knew what it was like to be shot at, and to see a fellow journalist shot in front of me. And so I took to heart the criticism that I\u2019d endangered my colleagues. I\u2019d been raised \u2013 raised at the <i> Times </i> \u2013 to believe the best way to confront ideas that some people might consider dangerous was to bring them out into the open. But I recognised that many of my colleagues thought that was wrong. And I said I would like to debate with them whether it was time to discard the old approach, and, if that was the case, what role opinion journalism should have at the <i> Times </i> . </p><p> As I look back at my notes of that awful day, I don\u2019t regret what I said. Even during that meeting, I was still hoping the blow-up might at last give me the chance either to win support for what I had been asked to do, or to clarify once and for all that the rules for journalism had changed at the <i> Times </i> . </p><p> But no one wanted to talk about that. Nor did they want to hear about all the voices of vulnerable or underprivileged people we had been showcasing in Opinion, or the ambitious new journalism we were doing. Instead, my <i> Times </i> colleagues demanded to know things such as the names of every editor who had had a role in the Cotton piece. Having seen what happened to Rubenstein I refused to tell them. A Slack channel had been set up to solicit feedback in real time during the meeting, and it was filling with hate. The meeting ran long, and finally came to a close after 90 minutes. </p><p> One last dismal task lay ahead. I had agreed to take the rare step of posting an \u201cEditor\u2019s Note\u201d on the Cotton op-ed describing what was supposedly wrong with it, and the publisher had asked a newsroom editor to draft it for him. Although I had urged Dao to come up with \u201cprocess\u201d criticisms, I tried to insist, as did Dao, that the note make clear the Cotton piece was within our editorial bounds. Sulzberger said he felt the <i> Times </i> could afford to be \u201csilent\u201d on that question. In the end the note went far further in repudiating the piece than I anticipated, saying it should never have been published at all. The next morning I was told to resign. </p><p><span> W </span> hat an intense period that was, inside the <i> Times </i> and across America. In spring 2020 covid-19 chased people into their homes in fear, and then, as spring turned to summer, the murder of George Floyd brought many of them out into the streets in anger. Or maybe the emotions were the other way around. We were also angry at the virus, and at the government\u2019s handling of it, and at our employers; and we were afraid of the police, or of the rioters, or of white people or black people, Democrats or Republicans. It was a terrible moment for the country. By the traditional \u2013 and perverse \u2013 logic of journalism, that should also have made it an inspiring time to be a reporter, writer or editor. Journalists are supposed to run towards scenes that others are fleeing, towards hard truths others need to know, towards consequential ideas they would prefer to ignore. </p><p> But fear got all mixed up with anger inside the <i> Times </i> , too, along with a desire to act locally in solidarity with the national movement. That energy found a focus in the Cotton op-ed. Scattered as we were by covid, none of us at the <i> Times </i> could speak face to face, and nobody was thinking very clearly. That seems understandable, given the frantic pile-up of circumstances. It would be reasonable now for all of us \u2013 me, Sulzberger, the journalists who were declaring their fright on Twitter \u2013 to look back, shake our heads and say that was a crazy time, and we all made some mistakes. </p><p> But the <i> Times </i> is not good at acknowledging mistakes. Indeed, one of my own, within the <i> Times </i> culture, was to take responsibility for any mistakes my department made, and even some it didn\u2019t. To Sulzberger, the meltdown over Cotton\u2019s op-ed and my departure in disgrace are explained and justified by a failure of editorial \u201cprocess\u201d. As he put it in an interview with the <i> New Yorker </i> this summer, after publishing his piece in the <i> Columbia Journalism Review </i> , Cotton\u2019s piece was not \u201cperfectly fact-checked\u201d and the editors had not \u201cthought about the headline and presentation\u201d. He contrasted the execution of Cotton\u2019s opinion piece with that of a months-long investigation the newsroom did of Donald Trump\u2019s taxes (which was not \u201cperfectly fact-checked\u201d, as it happens \u2013 it required a correction). He did not explain why, if the <i> Times </i> was an independent publication, an op-ed making a mainstream conservative argument should have to meet such different standards from an op-ed making any other kind of argument, such as for the abolition of the police. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough just to have the principle and wave it around,\u201d he said. \u201cYou also have to execute on it.\u201d </p><p> To me, extolling the virtue of independent journalism in the pages of the <i> Columbia Journalism Review </i> is how you wave a principle around. Publishing a piece like Cotton\u2019s is how you execute on it. As Sulzberger also wrote in the <i> Review </i> , \u201cIndependent journalism, especially in a pluralistic democracy, should err on the side of treating areas of serious political contest as open, unsettled, and in need of further inquiry.\u201d It matters that conflicting views do not just appear before different audiences in politically rivalrous publications or cable news networks, but instead in the same forum, before the same readers, subject to the same standards for fact and argumentation. That is also, by the way, an important means by which politicians, like Cotton, can learn, by speaking to audiences who are not inclined to nod along with them. That was our ambition for <i> Times </i> Opinion \u2013 or mine, I guess. Americans can shout about their lack of free speech all they want, but they will never be able to overcome their differences, and deal with any of their real problems, if they do not learn to listen to each other again. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20231213_1843_NYT_14.jpg\"><figcaption class=\"css-18w36g1 edweubf2\"><span> Baquet outside the <i> New York Times </i> building in 2019 </span></figcaption></figure><p> If Sulzberger must insist on comparing the execution of the Cotton op-ed with that of the most ambitious of newsroom projects, let him compare it with something really important, the 1619 Project, which commemorated the 400th anniversary of the arrival of enslaved Africans in Virginia. Like Cotton\u2019s piece, the 1619 Project was fact-checked and copy-edited (most of the <i> Times </i> newsroom does not fact-check or copy-edit articles, but the magazine does). But it nevertheless contained mistakes, as journalism often does. Some of these mistakes ignited a firestorm among historians and other readers. </p><p> And, like Cotton\u2019s piece, the 1619 Project was presented in a way the <i> Times </i> later judged to be too provocative. The <i> Times </i> declared that the 1619 Project \u201caims to reframe the country\u2019s history, understanding 1619 as our true founding\u201d. That bold statement \u2013 a declaration of <i> Times </i> fact, not opinion, since it came from the newsroom \u2013 outraged many Americans who venerated 1776 as the founding. The <i> Times </i> later stealthily erased it from the digital version of the project, but was caught doing so by a writer for the publication <i> Quillette </i> . Sulzberger told me during the initial uproar that the top editors in the newsroom \u2013 not just Baquet but his deputy \u2013 had not reviewed the audacious statement of purpose, one of the biggest editorial claims the paper has ever made. They also, of course, did not edit all the pieces themselves, trusting the magazine\u2019s editors to do that work. </p><p> If the 1619 Project and the Cotton op-ed shared the same supposed flaws and excited similar outrage, how come that one is lauded as a landmark success and the other is a sackable offence? In asking this, I am not running down the 1619 Project. It was excellent, above all because it made arguments readers should hear and consider. And to be clear: unlike Sulzberger, I do not see any equivalence between any huge project like that and a single op-ed piece. The parallel is absurd. I am comparing them only to meet Sulzberger on his terms, in order to illuminate what he is trying to elide. What distinguished the Cotton piece was not an error, or strong language, or that I didn\u2019t edit it personally. What distinguished that op-ed was not process. It was politics. It is one thing for the <i> Times </i> to aggravate historians, or conservatives, or even old-school liberals who believe in open debate. It has become quite another for the <i> Times </i> to challenge some members of its own staff with ideas that might contradict their view of the world. </p><p> The lessons of the incident are not about how to write a headline but about how much the <i> Times </i> has changed \u2013 how digital technology, the paper\u2019s new business model and the rise of new ideals among its staff have altered its understanding of the boundary between news and opinion, and of the relationship between truth and justice. Ejecting me was one way to avoid confronting the question of which values the <i> Times </i> is committed to. Waving around the word \u201cprocess\u201d is another. </p><p> What still seems most striking about the Cotton episode is how out of sync the leaders of the paper were with the ascendant, illiberal values within it. Cotton\u2019s essay brought into focus conflicts over the role of journalism that had been growing within the <i> Times </i> for years, and that the leadership has largely ducked away from. Is it journalism\u2019s role to salt wounds or to salve them, to promote debates or settle them, to ask or to answer? Is its proper posture humble or righteous? As journalists trained in what was once the conventional way, with the old set of principles, Sulzberger, Baquet and I reacted similarly to Cotton\u2019s essay: here\u2019s a potentially consequential idea from an influential voice. It may make readers uncomfortable, and they should know about it and evaluate it partly for that very reason. </p><p><i> Times </i> colleagues who were frightened or angry about the piece had the opposite view: that readers should not hear Cotton\u2019s argument. To expose them to it was to risk that they might be persuaded by an elected politician. </p><p> As he asserts the independence of <i> Times </i><i> Times </i><i> New Yorker </i></p><p><i> Times </i></p><p><i> Times </i><i> Times </i></p><p><i> Times </i><i> Times </i></p><p><i> Times </i><i> Times </i><i> Washington Post </i><i> Times </i><i> Times </i><i> Times </i></p><p><b> James Bennet </b> is </p>",

                            "text": "INVESTMENTS ARE RISING, BUT SO ARE COSTS\nFirst, the good news. By positioning themselves as neutral parties with growing middle classes and lower labour costs, Southeast Asian economies have disproportionately benefitted as companies relocate their China investments amid growing US-China tensions. The region attracted a record US$222.5 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2022 in a post-pandemic bump.\nThis trend continued in 2023, with the US unveiling billions of dollars in investments into Vietnam shortly after upgrading their ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership, including a US$1.6 billion chip factory by Amkor.\nChina, meanwhile, invested heavily in Southeast Asia\u2019s electric vehicle (EV) sector. Carmaker BYD is building a plant in Thailand and Geely announced a US$10 billion investment to develop  Malaysia\u2019s Automotive High-Tech Valley in Perak  .\nIf only US-China competition was all about who could invest the most into the region. Their rivalry has other serious implications.\nObservers should be wary of Washington\u2019s embrace of industrial policy, or government efforts to support strategic industries by eschewing free market policies for interventionism. Even as the Inflation Reduction Act pumps over US$369 billion into the US clean energy sector, other countries might launch their own industrial policies with an arsenal of subsidies to remain competitive.\nIn a worst-case scenario, FDI might be drawn away from the region and towards markets with better subsidies.\n\nGlobal demand for these minerals is expected to surge by 400 per cent to 600 per cent in the next several decades. Any shortage would have knock-on effects on the price of these fixtures, making green transitions more expensive.\n\nA case in point is the 2022 US Commerce Department investigation into eight solar panel companies in Southeast Asia (Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia) accused of skirting US tariffs on Chinese-sourced materials.\nThat the US is heavily reliant on these four countries for photovoltaic panels \u2013 accounting for about 75 per cent on imports in 2021 \u2013 was not enough to defend against bipartisan determination to crack down on \u201cunfair\u201d Chinese trade practices.\nNot only did the Commerce Department find the exporters guilty of skirting tariffs, but the US Congress voted to reinstate tariffs of up to 254 per cent on solar panels from Southeast Asia. President Joe Biden vetoed this legislative bid, but his waiver on retroactive tariffs only extends until June 2024.\nIn effect, Southeast Asian firms are caught between a rock and a hard place. They might be forced to choose between Chinese expertise and the lucrative US market, limiting their ability to grow and support their home country\u2019s green transition.\n\nNAVIGATING ROUGH WATERS, WITH HELP\nThe costs of a failed green transition are especially stark for Southeast Asia. One model by Deloitte predicted that the region could lose US$28 trillion over the next 50 years in losses from tourism, services and manufacturing if its carbon emissions are not addressed.\nWhile these challenges are steep, they are not insurmountable. There is still room to leverage the competition between the two superpowers to support the region\u2019s green transition.\n\nKevin Chen is an Associate Research Fellow with the US Programme at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.",

It also mentions the influence of US industrial policy and the potential consequences for FDI in the region. Furthermore, the article highlights the importance of the region's green transition and the potential costs of a failed transition.\n\nGiven the extensive coverage of the influence of technological changes, regional shifts, and the impact of US-China tensions on Southeast Asian economies, the article is highly relevant to the user's query.\n\nExplanation",
                    "relevant content": "INVESTMENTS ARE RISING, BUT SO ARE COSTS\nFirst, the good news. By positioning themselves as neutral parties with growing middle classes and lower labour costs, Southeast Asian economies have disproportionately benefitted as companies relocate their China investments amid growing US-China tensions. The region attracted a record US$222.5 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2022 in a post-pandemic bump.\nThis trend continued in 2023, with the US unveiling billions of dollars in investments into Vietnam shortly after upgrading their ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership, including a US$1.6 billion chip factory by Amkor.\nChina, meanwhile, invested heavily in Southeast Asia's electric vehicle (EV) sector. Carmaker BYD is building a plant in Thailand and Geely announced a US$10 billion investment to develop  Malaysia's Automotive High-Tech Valley in Perak  .\nIf only US-China competition was all about who could invest the most into the region. Their rivalry has other serious implications.\nObservers should be wary of Washington's embrace of industrial policy, or government efforts to support strategic industries by eschewing free market policies for interventionism. Even as the Inflation Reduction Act pumps over US$369 billion into the US clean energy sector, other countries might launch their own industrial policies with an arsenal of subsidies to remain competitive.\nIn a worst-case scenario, FDI might be drawn away from the region and towards markets with better subsidies.\n\nGlobal demand for these minerals is expected to surge by 400 per cent to 600 per cent in the next several decades. Any shortage would have knock-on effects on the price of these fixtures, making green transitions more expensive.\n\nA case in point is the 2022 US Commerce Department investigation into eight solar panel companies in Southeast Asia (Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia) accused of skirting US tariffs on Chinese-sourced materials.\nThat the US is heavily reliant on these four countries for photovoltaic panels  accounting for about 75 per cent on imports in 2021  was not enough to defend against bipartisan determination to crack down on \"unfair\" Chinese trade practices.\nNot only did the Commerce Department find the exporters guilty of skirting tariffs, but the US Congress voted to reinstate tariffs of up to 254 per cent on solar panels from Southeast Asia. President Joe Biden vetoed this legislative bid, but his waiver on retroactive tariffs only extends until June 2024.\nIn effect, Southeast Asian firms are caught between a rock and a hard place. They might be forced to choose between Chinese expertise and the lucrative US market, limiting their ability to grow and support their home country's green transition.\n\nNAVIGATING ROUGH WATERS, WITH HELP\nThe costs of a failed green transition are especially stark for Southeast Asia. One model by Deloitte predicted that the region could lose US$28 trillion over the next 50 years in losses from tourism, services and manufacturing if its carbon emissions are not addressed.\nWhile these challenges are steep, they are not insurmountable. There is still room to leverage the competition between the two superpowers to support the region's green transition.\n\nKevin Chen is an Associate Research Fellow with the US Programme at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore."

The article discusses the strong relationship between India and the United States, highlighting collaborations on trade, regional security, response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as technological support from the US to help India's transition to renewable energy by 2030. The article also touches upon the US' National Defence Strategy 2022, stating India's importance in Washington's vision to counter China, which signifies regional influence. Additionally, it mentions the concerns raised in Delhi due to the Republicans' call for tighter controls on immigration and criticisms of the Democrats' climate action plan, which could potentially impact India's foreign policy and regional influence. Finally, it addresses the importance of Indian-American voters and their strategic role in issues related to US-India ties, highlighting their potential influence on regional shifts. Therefore, the article contains relevant information related to the user's query.\n\nY",
                    "relevant content": "NEW DELHI: The relationship between India and the United States has never been stronger, according to analysts, but that may be tested by a potential power shift in the US Capitol.\nIndia, like many key partners of the US, is watching the upcoming midterm elections closely, as relations between both sides are at a crucial juncture.\nThe two nations now collaborate on trade, regional security, and response to the COVID-19 pandemic, bilaterally and through forums such as the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.\nSuch cooperation means that the relationship has largely received bipartisan support in the US Capitol.\nOver the past five years, India has moved closer than before to the US.\nPresident Joe Biden's administration has pledged financial and technological support to help Delhi's transition to renewable energy by 2030.\nRecently, it also promised to fast-track visa applications for Indian workers.\nVisiting Scholar in the Asia Program at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Dr Deep Pal, noted that the White House has been looking at a presidential commission's report which talks about speeding up the process of getting green cards.\nHe added that India and the US have set aggressive deadlines in their climate change collaboration.\nBut the Republicans have openly called for tighter controls on immigration and criticised the Democrats' climate action plan  raising concerns in Delhi. These plans will \"possibly not gain as much traction\", Dr Pal said.\nThe midterm elections, which will be held on Nov 8, are the first nationwide referendum on the president's performance. Historically, the president's party tends to fare poorly and lose ground during the midterms due to voters' frustrations with current issues.\n\nUNITING AGAINST CHINA\nAccording to the US' National Defence Strategy 2022, India is at the centre of Washington's vision to counter China. The same paper states that China is the US' \"most consequential strategic competitor\".\nIndia stands to benefit with the US on this front as well, as the US is crucial for maintaining its influence and security presence in the Indo-Pacific.\nBoth countries, along with Japan and Australia, are also part of the Quad, an alliance designed to counter China's assertive actions in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nCOURTING INDIAN-AMERICAN VOTERS\nIn the US, the Republicans and the Democrats have something in common as far as India's concerned.\nBoth parties have actively reached out to the Indian-American voter base, especially since Donald Trump's presidency. Indian-Americans form just about 1 per cent of the total US population, but both sides of the chamber have been focusing their attention on this group of voters.\nThey tend to lean towards the Democrats, but that's not stopped the GOP from reaching out to them.\nThe Biden-Harris administration recently hosted an event to celebrate the Hindu festival of Diwali.\nCampaigning Republicans also held a Diwali celebration. Among them was the incumbent Texas governor Greg Abbott and former president Donald Trump, who, with an eye on presidential polls in 2024, hosted Indian-Americans at his Mar-a-Lago resort.\nAnalysts said US-India ties are an important consideration for many Indian American voters, who could make all the difference in swing states.\n\"The Indian diaspora has also been very strategic in the way they have voted on a number of issues. So, I think the issue of diaspora is front and centre, and I think there are a number of key battleground states where the diaspora has the ability to shift the balance one way or another,\" said Professor Harsh Pant, vice-president of Studies and Foreign Policy at Observer Research Foundation.\nIf the Democrats hold on to the House and Senate, analysts expect the status quo to be maintained.\nBut if Republicans take back either or both  India may have to tweak its US policy.\nThat could mean concessions on trade tariffs and looking elsewhere for partners to fight climate change, making the midterms not only crucial for the US' future but also for India's foreign policy."

It\u2019s really habitual now and I still need to remind myself I don\u2019t need to wear it in most settings,\u201d she said.\nBeyond mask-wearing and heightened awareness of hygiene among some, Singapore\u2019s healthcare system has also seen major changes that are here to stay, such as the growing prevalence of telehealth.\nAs of Nov 14, there are 178 clinics offering consultations, antigen rapid testing or both through video conferencing in Singapore, according to the Ministry of Health's (MOH) website.\nWhile using video conferencing tools for medical consultations had been piloted prior to the pandemic, Integrated Health Information Systems (IHiS) assistant chief executive Alan Goh said the crisis served as \u201can impetus with accelerated adoption by both patients and providers\u201d.\nSuch services \u201cenabled a lean medical team to care for a large number of COVID-19 patients, while other healthcare workers could focus on providing care to patients with more urgent care needs in the acute hospitals\u201d despite stretched medical resources.\n\u201cAs Singapore transits into the COVID-19 endemic stage, we envisage that telehealth will continue to be a mainstay feature in Singapore\u2019s healthcare landscape offering greater convenience, improved accessibility to care, as well as time and cost savings for both providers and patients,\u201d said Mr Goh.\nPrior to COVID-19, IHiS \u2014 which is MOH\u2019s IT arm \u2014 had about 1,900 public healthcare patients using video consultations. The cumulative number jumped to more than 34,000 in 2020 and more than 120,000 in 2021.\nThe figure has continued to rise: By 2022, about 170,000 patients had sought their doctors online.\n\u201cWe see this as an opportunity to leverage the current momentum where there is now greater comfort and familiarity among residents in using digital solutions as part of their lived experience,\u201d said Mr Goh.\n\u201cThe core technology and care concepts will form the backbone behind expanded uses in areas such as virtual wards at home, and involvement of the community and social care sectors in supporting better health outcomes for our population.\u201d\n\n-\n\nE-COMMERCE\n\nWhile the 11.11 sales for these e-commerce platforms were much higher than a typical day, they did not disclose the total sales achieved \u2014 unlike in previous years.\n\n1\n-\n\nE-PAYMENTS\n\nEXPERTS ON WHY BEHAVIOURIAL CHANGES STICK AND OTHERS DON'T\nGiven the magnitude of COVID-19's devastation, affecting millions of lives and livelihoods around the world, it is inevitable that the pandemic caused some behavioural changes among people, experts told TODAY.\nAnd the reason why some behavioural changes have persisted, even as people learn to live with the virus, is because the benefits of adopting such changes outweigh the costs, said NUS sociologist Tan Ern Ser.\nFor example, technology has an increased presence in people\u2019s lives when it comes to shopping and work, among other things, because of its convenience, user-friendliness and time and cost savings.\nHowever, Dr Tan noted that human interaction and activities, such as verbal and non-verbal communication, cannot be fully facilitated by digital means.\n\u201cThe positive aspects of digital use remain, when necessary, but people return to a 'new normal' which allows for multidimensional human interactions, together with the use of digital means,\u201d he said.\nDr Ong from Research For Impact said that at an individual level, there may not be a clear way to predict why some behaviours shift back to a pre-pandemic mode quicker than others.\n\u201cIndividuals\u2019 own willingness to take risk, their subjective risk perceptions and the tangible or intangible costs and benefits inherent to personal circumstances all shape behaviours,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAll else equal, certain people may be more willing to take certain risks and go back to their pre-pandemic behaviours more quickly than others.\u201d\nMs Gianna Gayle Amul, senior policy researcher and director of communications at Research For Impact, reiterated that government policies played a large role in shaping behaviours during the pandemic.\n\u201cAt a more macro level, reversions in some behaviours can also be partly attributed to government policy, for instance, incentives that push for the return of tourism globally and rebooting the economy, not just locally but also globally,\u201d she said.\nWith most people in Singapore being up to date with their vaccinations or having had a COVID-19 infection at least once, there is also a degree of confidence that they would be safe from severe infection.\n\u201cAs a global city-state, Singapore cannot afford to remain closed and be left behind when the rest of the world has decided to \u2018move on\u2019 from the ongoing pandemic,\" said Ms Amul.\nThis story was originally published in  TODAY  .",

It's really habitual now and I still need to remind myself I don't need to wear it in most settings,\" she said.\nBeyond mask-wearing and heightened awareness of hygiene among some, Singapore's healthcare system has also seen major changes that are here to stay, such as the growing prevalence of telehealth.\nAs of Nov 14, there are 178 clinics offering consultations, antigen rapid testing or both through video conferencing in Singapore, according to the Ministry of Health's (MOH) website.\nWhile using video conferencing tools for medical consultations had been piloted prior to the pandemic, Integrated Health Information Systems (IHiS) assistant chief executive Alan Goh said the crisis served as \"an impetus with accelerated adoption by both patients and providers\".\nSuch services \"enabled a lean medical team to care for a large number of COVID-19 patients, while other healthcare workers could focus on providing care to patients with more urgent care needs in the acute hospitals\" despite stretched medical resources.\n\"As Singapore transits into the COVID-19 endemic stage, we envisage that telehealth will continue to be a mainstay feature in Singapore's healthcare landscape offering greater convenience, improved accessibility to care, as well as time and cost savings for both providers and patients,\" said Mr Goh.\nPrior to COVID-19, IHiS  which is MOH's IT arm  had about 1,900 public healthcare patients using video consultations. The cumulative number jumped to more than 34,000 in 2020 and more than 120,000 in 2021.\nThe figure has continued to rise: By 2022, about 170,000 patients had sought their doctors online.\n\"We see this as an opportunity to leverage the current momentum where there is now greater comfort and familiarity among residents in using digital solutions as part of their lived experience,\" said Mr Goh.\n\"The core technology and care concepts will form the backbone behind expanded uses in areas such as virtual wards at home, and involvement of the community and social care sectors in supporting better health outcomes for our population.\"\n\n-\n\nE-COMMERCE\n\nWhile the 11.11 sales for these e-commerce platforms were much higher than a typical day, they did not disclose the total sales achieved  unlike in previous years.\n\n1\n-\n\nE-PAYMENTS\n\nEXPERTS ON WHY BEHAVIOURIAL CHANGES STICK AND OTHERS DON'T\nGiven the magnitude of COVID-19's devastation, affecting millions of lives and livelihoods around the world, it is inevitable that the pandemic caused some behavioural changes among people, experts told TODAY.\nAnd the reason why some behavioural changes have persisted, even as people learn to live with the virus, is because the benefits of adopting such changes outweigh the costs, said NUS sociologist Tan Ern Ser.\nFor example, technology has an increased presence in people's lives when it comes to shopping and work, among other things, because of its convenience, user-friendliness and time and cost savings.\nHowever, Dr Tan noted that human interaction and activities, such as verbal and non-verbal communication, cannot be fully facilitated by digital means.\n\"The positive aspects of digital use remain, when necessary, but people return to a 'new normal' which allows for multidimensional human interactions, together with the use of digital means,\" he said.\nDr Ong from Research For Impact said that at an individual level, there may not be a clear way to predict why some behaviours shift back to a pre-pandemic mode quicker than others.\n\"Individuals' own willingness to take risk, their subjective risk perceptions and the tangible or intangible costs and benefits inherent to personal circumstances all shape behaviours,\" she said.\n\"All else equal, certain people may be more willing to take certain risks and go back to their pre-pandemic behaviours more quickly than others.\"\nMs Gianna Gayle Amul, senior policy researcher and director of communications at Research For Impact, reiterated that government policies played a large role in shaping behaviours during the pandemic.\n\"At a more macro level, reversions in some behaviours can also be partly attributed to government policy, for instance, incentives that push for the return of tourism globally and rebooting the economy, not just locally but also globally,\" she said.\nWith most people in Singapore being up to date with their vaccinations or having had a COVID-19 infection at least once, there is also a degree of confidence that they would be safe from severe infection.\n\"As a global city-state, Singapore cannot afford to remain closed and be left behind when the rest of the world has decided to 'move on' from the ongoing pandemic,\" said Ms Amul.\nThis story was originally published in  TODAY  ."

Video: Mediacorp Brand Studio\n\n1. ELEVATED PRICES, RESTRICTIVE MACRO POLICY, LOWER GROWTH: UNDERSTANDING THE FINANCIAL LANDSCAPE\nChallenge:  While inflation has fallen from its peak in 2022, interest rates and the cost of capital are expected to stay elevated in the near term relative to the past decade. Accordingly, macroeconomic policies remain largely restrictive compared to before 2021, which, in turn, raises the risk of lower growth, increased business costs and market volatility.\n\nApproach:  Temasek is building a diversified and forward-looking investment portfolio that can withstand economic shocks and market volatility. This portfolio has two components: A long-term resilient component that can provide stable and sustainable returns, or liquidity in the form of dividend income and distributions; and a shorter-term, dynamic component, where capital is recycled for investing in higher-growth opportunities for higher returns.\n\n\u201cIn doing so, we want to capitalise on growth opportunities with the potential for sustainable returns above our risk-adjusted cost of capital over the long term,\u201d said Ms Png. \u201cFor that, we must do three things. Firstly, maintain a very strong balance sheet. Secondly, protect the core of our portfolio by supporting the strategies of our portfolio companies and being an enabler for their success, and lastly, position our portfolio for growth.\u201d\n\n2. GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS & DECOUPLING IN A POST-COVID WORLD: STEERING THROUGH UNCERTAIN WATERS\nChallenge:  Shifting geopolitical dynamics can significantly impact international investments. The past decade has seen heightened tensions due to geopolitical conflicts, rivalry among the major powers, and supply chains decoupling in a post COVID-19 world.\n\nApproach:  Temasek incorporates strategic geopolitical risk assessments in its investment decisions \u2013 ensuring a pragmatic approach towards international relations. Its international policy and governance teams \u2013 located in Beijing, Brussels, Singapore and Washington DC \u2013 actively monitor geopolitical risks and consider how policy changes in key markets might affect its activities. Temasek is currently tracking the trend of decoupling and de-risking, which may disrupt global supply chains.\n\n3. TRADE AND INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS: MANAGING REGULATORY REALITIES\nChallenge:  The trade and investment regulatory environment has grown more complex as more countries adopt measures to protect national assets and critical industries. This trend is characterised by tighter trade and investment restrictions, heightened regulatory scrutiny, and greater enforcement actions. The International Monetary Fund estimates that trade restrictions will lead to global output losses of close to 2 per cent.\n\nApproach:  Temasek complies with legal and regulatory obligations across all jurisdictions it operates or invests in. The company\u2019s legal and regulatory department ensures that policies, processes and systems align with prevailing laws, and keeps abreast of regulatory developments \u2013 ensuring compliance with trade and investment, merger control, and export control regimes.\n\n\u201cAs a global investor headquartered in Singapore, Temasek\u2019s portfolio is diversified across geographies but remains anchored in Asia,\u201d noted Ms Png. \u201cThis reduces Temasek\u2019s reliance on specific markets. At the same time, we invest in companies with strong domestic demand as this can minimise the impact of trade and investment restrictions on their operations.\u201d\n\n4. SUSTAINABILITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE: AIMING FOR NET ZERO\nChallenge:  The transition to a net-zero world has faced setbacks due to concerns over energy security and affordability, which are partly due to the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war. This has momentarily slowed down decarbonisation efforts, even as the repercussions of climate change on economies and societies intensify.\n\nApproach:  Sustainability is at the core of everything that Temasek does. As a company, it has been carbon neutral since 2020. It has also set a target to reduce net carbon emissions from its portfolio to half its 2010 levels by 2030 \u2013 aiming to reach net zero by 2050.\n\nTo achieve its goals, Temasek actively participates in the acceleration of decarbonisation efforts globally. It invests in climate-aligned opportunities in the areas of food, water, waste, energy, materials, clean transportation and the built environment, while also enabling carbon-negative solutions and encouraging decarbonisation efforts in its portfolio companies. It is also catalysing financing to accelerate the adoption of green energy and decarbonisation solutions, uplifting communities through impact investing, and forming partnerships with like-minded organisations.\n\n5. CYBER RISKS: SAFEGUARDING IN THE TECHNOLOGICAL AGE\nChallenge:  The rising threat of cyberattacks poses a substantial risk to businesses and communities. Recent cybersecurity breaches serve as a timely reminder that all companies are vulnerable to such attacks, with advancements in technologies like 5G connectivity and artificial intelligence (AI) potentially exacerbating the risk.\n\nApproach:\n\n6. INDUSTRY 4.0 AND WORKFORCE 4.0: PREPARING FOR THE FUTURE\nChallenge:  Traditional operating models are being revolutionised by the emergence of Industry 4.0 \u2013 characterised by increasing automation, the employment of smart machines and the advent of human-led AI \u2013 and Workforce 4.0, which refers to a workforce that thrives in a digitally driven environment. Although Industry 4.0 has boosted economic productivity, it has also led to social challenges such as job displacements and rising inequality.\n\nApproach:\n\nExternally, Temasek supports the upskilling of employees within its portfolio companies by working with them, their unions and their workforce to understand and anticipate shifts in their respective sectors. An initiative known as the Temasek Tripartite Conversations brings together relevant government agencies, trade unions and organisations to look at the changing roles and the necessary reskilling and upskilling needs of its workers to prepare them for the jobs of the future.",

It also aims to anticipate emerging trends with clear thinking and judgement.\n\"We live in a world characterised by volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity, and Temasek's strategy reflects the importance of staying agile and adaptable to build a resilient, forward-looking portfolio,\" said Ms Png Chin Yee, chief financial officer at Temasek. \"Our T2030 strategy is a 10-year road map that guides our strategic planning, capability-building and institutional development initiatives to help us deliver sustainable value over the long term.\"\n\nIn 30 seconds, see how Temasek's T2030 strategy tackles six top-of-mind global challenges  with the aim of fostering resilience and sustainable returns over the long term.\n\nIn 30 seconds, see how Temasek's T2030 strategy tackles six top-of-mind global challenges  with the aim of fostering resilience and sustainable returns over the long term.

ELEVATED PRICES, RESTRICTIVE MACRO POLICY, LOWER GROWTH: UNDERSTANDING THE FINANCIAL LANDSCAPE\nChallenge:  While inflation has fallen from its peak in 2022, interest rates and the cost of capital are expected to stay elevated in the near term relative to the past decade. Accordingly, macroeconomic policies remain largely restrictive compared to before 2021, which, in turn, raises the risk of lower growth, increased business costs and market volatility.\n\nApproach:  Temasek is building a diversified and forward-looking investment portfolio that can withstand economic shocks and market volatility. This portfolio has two components: A long-term resilient component that can provide stable and sustainable returns, or liquidity in the form of dividend income and distributions; and a shorter-term, dynamic component, where capital is recycled for investing in higher-growth opportunities for higher returns.\n\n\"In doing so, we want to capitalise on growth opportunities with the potential for sustainable returns above our risk-adjusted cost of capital over the long term,\" said Ms Png. \"For that, we must do three things. Firstly, maintain a very strong balance sheet. Secondly, protect the core of our portfolio by supporting the strategies of our portfolio companies and being an enabler for their success, and lastly, position our portfolio for growth.\"\n\n2. GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS & DECOUPLING IN A POST-COVID WORLD: STEERING THROUGH UNCERTAIN WATERS\nChallenge:  Shifting geopolitical dynamics can significantly impact international investments. The past decade has seen heightened tensions due to geopolitical conflicts, rivalry among the major powers, and supply chains decoupling in a post COVID-19 world.\n\nApproach:  Temasek incorporates strategic geopolitical risk assessments in its investment decisions  ensuring a pragmatic approach towards international relations. Its international policy and governance teams  located in Beijing, Brussels, Singapore and Washington DC  actively monitor geopolitical risks and consider how policy changes in key markets might affect its activities. Temasek is currently tracking the trend of decoupling and de-risking, which may disrupt global supply chains.\n\n3. TRADE AND INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS: MANAGING REGULATORY REALITIES\nChallenge:  The trade and investment regulatory environment has grown more complex as more countries adopt measures to protect national assets and critical industries. This trend is characterised by tighter trade and investment restrictions, heightened regulatory scrutiny, and greater enforcement actions. The International Monetary Fund estimates that trade restrictions will lead to global output losses of close to 2 per cent.\n\nApproach:  Temasek complies with legal and regulatory obligations across all jurisdictions it operates or invests in. The company's legal and regulatory department ensures that policies, processes and systems align with prevailing laws, and keeps abreast of regulatory developments  ensuring compliance with trade and investment, merger control, and export control regimes.\n\n\"As a global investor headquartered in Singapore, Temasek's portfolio is diversified across geographies but remains anchored in Asia,\" noted Ms Png. \"This reduces Temasek's reliance on specific markets. At the same time, we invest in companies with strong domestic demand as this can minimise the impact of trade and investment restrictions on their operations.\"\n\n4. SUSTAINABILITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE: AIMING FOR NET ZERO\nChallenge:  The transition to a net-zero world has faced setbacks due to concerns over energy security and affordability, which are partly due to the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war. This has momentarily slowed down decarbonisation efforts, even as the repercussions of climate change on economies and societies intensify.\n\nApproach:  Sustainability is at the core of everything that Temasek does. As a company, it has been carbon neutral since 2020. It has also set a target to reduce net carbon emissions from its portfolio to half its 2010 levels by 2030  aiming to reach net zero by 2050.\n\nTo achieve its goals, Temasek actively participates in the acceleration of decarbonisation efforts globally. It invests in climate-aligned opportunities in the areas of food, water, waste, energy, materials, clean transportation and the built environment, while also enabling carbon-negative solutions and encouraging decarbonisation efforts in its portfolio companies. It is also catalysing financing to accelerate the adoption of green energy and decarbonisation solutions, uplifting communities through impact investing, and forming partnerships with like-minded organisations.\n\n5. CYBER RISKS: SAFEGUARDING IN THE TECHNOLOGICAL AGE\nChallenge:  The rising threat of cyberattacks poses a substantial risk to businesses and communities. Recent cybersecurity breaches serve as a timely reminder that all companies are vulnerable to such attacks, with advancements in technologies like 5G connectivity and artificial intelligence (AI) potentially exacerbating the risk.\n\nApproach:\n\n6. INDUSTRY 4.0 AND WORKFORCE 4.0: PREPARING FOR THE FUTURE\nChallenge:  Traditional operating models are being revolutionised by the emergence of Industry 4.0  characterised by increasing automation, the employment of smart machines and the advent of human-led AI  and Workforce 4.0, which refers to a workforce that thrives in a digitally driven environment. Although Industry 4.0 has boosted economic productivity, it has also led to social challenges such as job displacements and rising inequality.\n\nApproach:\n\nExternally, Temasek supports the upskilling of employees within its portfolio companies by working with them, their unions and their workforce to understand and anticipate shifts in their respective sectors.

But still, China reported a drop in foreign direct investment inflows during the first four months of this year.

Once companies leave, they won\u2019t come back,\u201d said Liu Kaiming, head of the Shenzhen-based Institute of Contemporary Observation, which monitors the working conditions of Chinese contract manufacturers.\n\u201cA large number of Chinese companies also continue to invest in overseas capacity to survive,\u201d Liu said. \u201cThis is a trend that will not stop.\n\u201cChina\u2019s re-export trade to ASEAN (countries) over the past two years has been substantial, mainly in the export of raw materials, which will actually increasingly be produced in Vietnam and other emerging markets.\u201d\nRaymond Yow, a US trader who imports home-improvement products such as household decorations, cement boards, solar panels and LED lights to American retailers, attended the Canton Fair in Guangzhou last month, browsing new products and meeting manufacturers.\nBut he also planned to go to Vietnam and Indonesia to explore potential new and cheaper supplies.\nYow was already thinking about importing from Indonesia \u2013 where wood resources are abundant and prices are low. But an increase in overseas consumer opposition to Chinese-made products, especially in the middle parts of the US, has put pressure on his retail clients, giving him further impetus to take action.\n\u201c\u2018Replace those made in China if you could,\u2019 they would suggest,\u201d he said.\nNonetheless, Yow noted how doing business in China still has its \u201cincomparable advantages\u201d, compared with Southeast Asia. He pointed to greater e-commerce convenience, relatively efficient logistics, and more sophisticated industrial and supply chains.\nBut because of that external pressure, he has to seek more diversification options, even though the undertaking means a lot more work.",

Still, he does not expect the trend to derail supply-chain adjustments.\n\"It's a tricky time now  we're not seeing supply-chain delays, but demand push-backs,\" he said, referring to customers requesting that product deliveries be postponed. \"There is no delay (in embracing) the China-plus-one model, but companies will slow production with the weak demand.\"\nThe model, as it has commonly become known, involves manufacturers staying in China, but reducing their outsized reliance on it as a production base by shifting operations elsewhere.\nDigre said his company also adjusted its supply chain to avoid punitive tariffs imposed by the US and China on each other amid their trade war that began in 2018.\n\"The company has moved its production from the US to China to escape the high import tariffs on certain components. At the same time, some finishing products made in China will be moved to the plus-one production lines to avoid import tariffs when they are shipped back to the US,\" he said.\nMatthew Fass, president of Maritime Products International in the US state of Virginia, said the inventory situation, the trade war and depressed demand have all complicated the decision-making process surrounding supply chains.\n\"We are still trying to understand the 'new normal' with supply-chain management and even consumer trends coming out of COVID-19,\" Fass said. \"This current dynamic does make it more challenging to understand the best ways to work toward healthy supply-chain diversification.\n\"It is a misperception (to think) that many of the seafood supply chains exist in China based solely on some easily interchangeable availability of labour or a favourable regulatory environment,\" he said, noting how supply chains take decades to build up.\nIn the midst of this growing trend by companies to relocate and diversify operations to reduce their China exposure, domestic analysts have been sounding alarms about economic impact. And many have called on Beijing to take steps to retain leading foreign companies amid such supply-chain adjustments, while also urging Chinese companies to upgrade their industrial chains.\nChinese leadership has responded with an all-out push to woo foreign investors. But still, China reported a drop in foreign direct investment inflows during the first four months of this year. And its recent national security raids of foreign consultancy firms have pushed foreign companies to further reassess the risks associated with operating in China.\n\"There's been talk that the US-led decoupling is a delusion, but I don't agree.

                            "text": "[Sponsored Article]\nBritish mathematician Clive Humby famously coined the phrase \u201cData is the new oil\u201d in 2006. Since then, many organizations have scrambled to embrace this maxim, ensuring they have a robust data strategy to inform decision-making for every function from finance to marketing and logistics to production.\n\nToday, data is being generated, stored, and analyzed at staggering rates worldwide. According to a  Forbes  study in 2018, over 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are produced in the digital universe every single day. Along with this rapid growth of data, the rise of social media has encouraged researchers and data users to tap unconventional data sources and methods to explain and predict economic or behavioral outcomes in various domains such as finance (e.g., stock price), marketing (e.g., brand reputation, consumer purchasing behavior), and politics (e.g., voting behavior).\n\nUnconventional data, more commonly referred to as big data, is unstructured and undefined. Such data is characterized as high-volume, high-velocity, high-variety, and/or highly semantic, and advanced techniques and applications, as well as high-performance computing, are often required to collect and process it. Big data analytics, including data mining methods and machine learning algorithms, allow users to gain a deep understanding of behavior.\n\nThe Internet has become a part of modern life, and it is almost second nature for people to express their views and preferences on social media. The emergence of platforms such as Facebook, Uber, Taobao, and peer-to-peer applications, and new computing and communications technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G cellular networks, has generated tremendous amounts of new data that opens up the possibility to study a wide range of human behaviors.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Center for Business and Social Analytics (CBSA) of the HKUST Business School leverages massive amounts of social big data to generate quality insights that aid business and social decision and policy making. To date, a majority of academic and industry research is based on conventional data from opinion polls, surveys, and lab or field experiments, which suffer from sample selection bias or lack generalizability. The Center takes advantage of social big data to tackle complex business and social problems by listening to what the crowd actually says. The following are sample projects undertaken by the Center.\n\nHong Kong Tourism Index\nThe tourism industry is one of the four pillar industries in Hong Kong. Mainland China is the major tourism market of Hong Kong, accounting for nearly 80% of visitor arrivals in 2019. In view of the tendency of Chinese tourists to share their travel experiences and sentiments on social networks, the Center has collaborated with Wisers, the world's leading expert in big data and AI analytics, to construct a series of predictive tourism indexes for government monitoring and other business interests.\n\nWe collect massive volumes of data from digital platforms frequently used by Chinese travelers, including Sina Microblog, Baidu Tieba, Douban, Mafengwo, Xiaohongshu, and Douyin. The total amount of data extracted from these platforms exceeds 10 million observations per day. To account for the seasonality in tourism demand and key sociopolitical events in Hong Kong, we focus on the period of January 2018 to December 2020. It is imperative to gain a systematic understanding of the various factors impacting Hong Kong's tourism industry.\n\nWe draw on the latest natural language processing technologies and advanced statistical models to process and quantify the data, and establish a multivariate time series forecasting model and a series of predictive indexes that are updated in real time. With the error rate as low as 4% (in terms of Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error, sMAPE), these indexes predict the occupancy rates of Hong Kong hotels, the number of visitors to Hong Kong, and the average daily rates of Hong Kong hotels.\n\nWe anticipate that our work will enable the Hong Kong Government and the tourism industry to obtain accurate forecasts, trends, and insights in the future concerning the local tourism industry, and formulate more sustainable and data-driven tourism policies and strategies.\n\nFinSent \u2013 An Interactive Sentiment Analysis Dashboard Based on FinBERT\nThe Center has been developing a first-of-its-kind sentiment analysis dashboard based on FinBERT, a BERT model that outperforms other language models in the sentiment classification of financial texts. Aptly named FinSent, the fully automated dashboard visualizes sentiments of financial texts using cutting-edge natural language processing technologies, enabling users to gain insights into the financial sentiments of publicly traded companies through charts, graphs, and color-coded sentiment scores.\n\nFinSent comprises an automated module that collects and processes corporate 10-K and 10-Q filings and earnings call transcripts of public companies on a daily basis. The sentiments towards the companies are presented via an interactive dashboard that allows users to freely customize the content. The following diagram shows an example of the FinSent interface:\n\nSpillover of Social Media Sentiments\nIn recent decades, the rise of social media has aided the free flow of public information. It has also become a reliable platform for people around the world to interact and share their opinions in an affordable, anonymous, and uncensored manner. While countless benefits have been accrued from the use of social media, some complicated and worrying challenges have surfaced in recent years, catching the attention of researchers, policymakers, and members of the public. It is necessary to understand the difference between real-life and online communications, and how this affects our behavior and mental health.\n\nTo address this issue, we study the spillover of social media sentiments in the English Premier League (EPL) soccer community using data from Reddit. We apply sentiment analysis with a machine learning model to all the contents in our dataset to capture the sentiment of the contents. The model outputs the likelihood of those contents being positive, neutral, or negative.\n\nWe trace the contents created by each author and provide evidence of how their next sentiments will change from the current one with a transition matrix. The transition matrix shows that sentiments of the next content differ depending on their current sentiments. Users will more likely produce negative sentiment contents when they generate negative contents (42.39%). On the other hand, sentiments of the next contents are more likely positive when they produce positive sentiment contents (27.60%) rather than negative ones (17.09%). Thus, we consider the sentiment of the current content as one of the controls when we estimate the model.\n\nWith 3.6 million pieces of content from 20 EPL subreddits in the 2017/2018 season, we run a regression model to check whether the sentiments of what users see would affect the sentiment of their next piece of content. The dependent variable of the model is the difference between the likelihood for the content to be positive and negative. A positive index means the content is more likely to be positive. Similarly, a negative index means the content is more likely to be negative. The main independent variable is a sentiment index, which measures the sentiments of contents that users see between their posts. Furthermore, we control various confounding factors, including the sentiment of their previous posts.\nWe find strong evidence of spillover effects from the sentiments. The estimate of the sentiment index (0.0481) is significant and positive. It means that emotions on social media are contagious and can easily intensify. Social media users should recognize this spillover to their emotions and avoid being manipulated by other social media users. Learning how to deal with an increasingly polarized online environment and offensive conversations is important if we are to be responsible netizens.\n\nThe National Security Law (NSL) and Social Media Sentiments\nOne of the Center's research projects investigates how the actions initiated by the different authorities\u2014such as the Chinese government, HKSAR, and international governments\u2014and the implementation of the NSL on 1 July 2020 influenced the sentiments in various media channels in Hong Kong.

This means descriptive analytics can help identify potential problems or future opportunities for business.\nIn my collaboration with the Microsoft Bing search engine  2  , we have developed an interpretable machine learning model that can track, quantify, and interpret users\u2019 topical preferences underlying each search query and across search contexts (e.g., time, location, and demographics). The proposed model leverages data on user queries, subsequent click-through on search results, and all textual information encountered on the search engine. The outputs of our proposed model can help search engines (advertisers) improve their search results (keyword and ad copy strategies).\nA group of researchers at Humboldt University Berlin  3  proposed a methodology to analyze the co-occurrences of products in consumer shopping baskets, by leveraging the recent advances in natural language processing and machine learning. Their proposed method is well-suited to retailers because it relies on data that is readily available from their checkout systems and facilitates their analyses of cross-category product complementarity, in addition to within-category substitution. The proposed approach also has high usability because it is automated and scalable.\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a similar spirit, my working paper on the vending market  4  aims to help retailers improve their product assortment strategies across different vending locations and within each vending location simultaneously. We propose an automatic machine learning model using consumer transaction data across different vending locations. Our proposed model can (i) profile different consumer segments driven by location preferences, (ii) quantify the differences in product preferences across these consumer segments, and (iii) understand the relationships (e.g., substitution and complementarity) across products and vending locations.\nPredictive Analytics\nPredictive analytics refers to the process of using current and/or historical data, combined with statistical techniques, to assess the likelihood of a certain event happening in the future by answering the questions: \u201cWhat will happen?\u201d or \u201cWhen will it happen?\u201d. Predictive analytics have been used for a variety of prediction problems in marketing, such as credit scoring, new customer acquisitions, customer churn, customer lifetime value, click-through on ads, purchase incidence, and product recommendations. Therefore, predictive analytics can help improve many areas of a business, including efficiency, customer service, and risk reduction.\nDaily, Monday to Friday\n\nChina at a Glance Newsletter\n\nYour daily must-read of essential stories from China, including politics, economy and current affairs.\n\nBy submitting, you consent to receiving marketing emails from SCMP.

[5] provides an excellent review on the existing methodologies for user response prediction in online advertising. These methods can also be applied for prediction problems in other contexts.\nIn particular, Deep Learning (DL) has received significant attention for prediction tasks in marketing over the past few years. DL is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks, in which multiple layers of processing are used to extract progressively higher level features from data. In addition to superior prediction accuracy, DL can process much more information from many different sources. Not only is it able to do this on an unparalleled scale, but it is also capable of bringing together disparate types of information \u2014 images, audio, app data, clickstream data, location data, social network data \u2014 in a way that other systems cannot handle.\nAdvertisement\n\nNevertheless, one of the common complaints about the existing predictive analytics is that the tools are too much like black boxes, with no insight into what goes on during the process after input. Hence, there may be potential negative consequences when blindly relying on algorithms to optimize predictions. For example, a recent study  6  shows that algorithms underpinning Facebook\u2019s advertising platform started to discriminate by showing different people different types of housing or employment opportunities. That ultimately resulted in the algorithm showing more ads for secretarial jobs to women and more ads for jobs in the lumber industry to men, as one example. Therefore, it is important for companies to decide how to trade-off between accuracy and interpretability/transparency for a given problem on hand.\nPrescriptive Analytics\nPrescriptive analytics refer to the application of testing and other techniques to determine which outcome will yield the best result in a given scenario by answering the questions: \u201cwhy it will happen?\u201d or \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d. Prescriptive Analytics often extends beyond predictive analytics by specifying both the actions necessary to achieve predicted outcomes and the interrelated effects of each decision. Please see Diaphragm 1 for an illustration of the relationship between predictive and prescriptive analytics.\n\nRandomized experiments, such as A/B testing, are commonly used by companies to determine the best ad copy, pricing point, targeting strategy, etc. The basic idea is to randomly allocate the experimental units across different treatment conditions, and then identify the treatment condition that yields the best outcome of interests. The biggest advantage of randomization is to reduce bias by equalising other factors that have not been explicitly accounted for the in study design. However, randomized experiments are either too costly or infeasible in most business problems. Therefore, a major class of prescriptive analytics generate proactive decisions on the basis of the predictive analytics outcomes using quasi-experimental or observational data.\n\nIn my recent publication  7  , we aim to help practitioners understand the value of investigating in \u201cmoment marketing\u201d which entails the ability to synchronize online advertising (e.g., sponsored search) in real time with relevant offline events such as TV ads. We conduct causal estimation by leveraging large variations in TV advertising expenditure over a long period for a major brand in the U.S. fast food industry. Based on statistical analysis, we show that TV-moment-based search advertising could be effective for optimizing sponsored search advertising for both TV-advertised brands and their competitors. We also document the mechanisms driving such cross-channel advertising effects. Specifically, TV advertising can change the quality of online search traffic (e.g., who searches, where they search, and how they search) in the moments following a TV ad, so that an average searcher responds differently to subsequent search results.\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a similar project  8  , we measure the effects of major TV advertisers\u2019 temporary discontinuation of TV advertising on consumer keyword search behavior. We leverage a field experiment in the US wireless industry in which the focal brand stopped its TV advertising for one randomly chosen week. We develop a statistical method to simulate the search volume for different topical search keywords under different TV advertising expenditure at one point in time. These simulations can provide insights for advertisers to improve their cross-channel advertising strategies.\nIn my working paper on livestreaming markets  9  , we estimate how consumer price elasticity (or willingness-to-pay) for knowledge goods varies over the entire product life-cycle. We achieve this by leveraging the most recent advances in machine learning and statistics. Our proposed model is trained using large-scale historical transaction records, along with high-dimensional information about products, sellers, consumers, and the platform. Our proposed methodology can not only provide descriptive insights on consumer purchase patterns, but also derive optimal pricing point for a give product over each time period of the product life-cycle.\nLooking Forward\nBusinesses are increasingly utilising data to discover insights that can aid them in creating business strategy, making decisions, and delivering better products, services and personalised online experiences. The three distinct marketing analytics are complementary and valuable in this process.\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile models and algorithms often outperform humans, domain knowledge, reasoning, and, ultimately, decision making rest in the hands of an end user. Since many of the algorithms underlying the analytics take a black-box approach, it often leaves little room for injecting domain expertise, and can result in frustration from analysts when results seem spurious or confusing. Therefore, it is very important for business leaders to create interdisciplinary teams to continuously monitor and evaluate data for bias.\nLast but not least, with the growing concern about privacy, new regulations have driven companies to take steps and examine how they can make their data more transparent to customers, as well as more reliable and relevant. As a result, this calls for efforts and techniques that can deliver a solution that doesn\u2019t need a wealth of data to function but is also able to process, whenever possible, large volumes of data.\nReferences\n1 Gordon, Jonathan, Jesko Perrey, and Dennis Spillecke. \"Big data, analytics and the future of marketing and sales.\" McKinsey: Digital Advantage (2013).\n2 Liu, Jia, Olivier Toubia, and Shawndra Hill (2020), \u201cContent-based Model of Web Search Behavior: An Application to TV Show Search.\u201d forthcoming at Management Science.\n3 Gabel, Sebastian, Daniel Guhl, and Daniel Klapper. \"P2V-MAP: Mapping market structures for large retail assortments.\" Journal of Marketing Research 56.4 (2019): 557-580.\n4 Liu, Jia, and Kohei Kawaguchi, \u201cLocation-Based Market Structure: A Dynamic Analysis of Product Assortment and Consumer Purchases in Panel Data.\u201d Working paper.\n5 Gharibshah, Zhabiz, and Xingquan Zhu. \"User Response Prediction in Online Advertising.\" ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR) 54.3 (2021): 1-43.\n6 Ali, Muhammad, et al. \"Discrimination through optimization: How Facebook's Ad delivery can lead to biased outcomes.\" Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction 3.CSCW (2019): 1-30.\n7 Liu, Jia, and Shawndra Hill (2021), \u201cMoment Marketing: Measuring Dynamics in Cross-channel Ad Effectiveness.\u201d Marketing Science, 40 (1), 13-22.\n8 Liu, Jia, Shawndra Hill, and David Rothschild (2021), \u201cThe Impact of Temporally Turning off TV Ad on Search: A Generalized Synthetic Control Estimator under Interference.\u201d Working paper.\n9 Cong, Ziwei, Jia Liu, and Puneet Manchanda. \"The Role of 'Live' in Livestreaming Markets: Evidence Using Orthogonal Random Forest.\" Working paper.",

This means descriptive analytics can help identify potential problems or future opportunities for business.\nIn my collaboration with the Microsoft Bing search engine  2  , we have developed an interpretable machine learning model that can track, quantify, and interpret users' topical preferences underlying each search query and across search contexts (e.g., time, location, and demographics). The proposed model leverages data on user queries, subsequent click-through on search results, and all textual information encountered on the search engine. The outputs of our proposed model can help search engines (advertisers) improve their search results (keyword and ad copy strategies).\nA group of researchers at Humboldt University Berlin  3  proposed a methodology to analyze the co-occurrences of products in consumer shopping baskets, by leveraging the recent advances in natural language processing and machine learning. Their proposed method is well-suited to retailers because it relies on data that is readily available from their checkout systems and facilitates their analyses of cross-category product complementarity, in addition to within-category substitution. The proposed approach also has high usability because it is automated and scalable.\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a similar spirit, my working paper on the vending market  4  aims to help retailers improve their product assortment strategies across different vending locations and within each vending location simultaneously. We propose an automatic machine learning model using consumer transaction data across different vending locations. Our proposed model can (i) profile different consumer segments driven by location preferences, (ii) quantify the differences in product preferences across these consumer segments, and (iii) understand the relationships (e.g., substitution and complementarity) across products and vending locations.\nPredictive Analytics\nPredictive analytics refers to the process of using current and/or historical data, combined with statistical techniques, to assess the likelihood of a certain event happening in the future by answering the questions: \"What will happen?\" or \"When will it happen?\". Predictive analytics have been used for a variety of prediction problems in marketing, such as credit scoring, new customer acquisitions, customer churn, customer lifetime value, click-through on ads, purchase incidence, and product recommendations. Therefore, predictive analytics can help improve many areas of a business, including efficiency, customer service, and risk reduction.\nDaily, Monday to Friday\n\nChina at a Glance Newsletter\n\nYour daily must-read of essential stories from China, including politics, economy and current affairs.\n\nBy submitting, you consent to receiving marketing emails from SCMP.

[5] provides an excellent review on the existing methodologies for user response prediction in online advertising. These methods can also be applied for prediction problems in other contexts.\nIn particular, Deep Learning (DL) has received significant attention for prediction tasks in marketing over the past few years. DL is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks, in which multiple layers of processing are used to extract progressively higher level features from data. In addition to superior prediction accuracy, DL can process much more information from many different sources.

Hence, there may be potential negative consequences when blindly relying on algorithms to optimize predictions. For example, a recent study  6  shows that algorithms underpinning Facebook's advertising platform started to discriminate by showing different people different types of housing or employment opportunities. That ultimately resulted in the algorithm showing more ads for secretarial jobs to women and more ads for jobs in the lumber industry to men, as one example. Therefore, it is important for companies to decide how to trade-off between accuracy and interpretability/transparency for a given problem on hand.\nPrescriptive Analytics\nPrescriptive analytics refer to the application of testing and other techniques to determine which outcome will yield the best result in a given scenario by answering the questions: \"why it will happen?\" or \"What should I do?\". Prescriptive Analytics often extends beyond predictive analytics by specifying both the actions necessary to achieve predicted outcomes and the interrelated effects of each decision. Please see Diaphragm 1 for an illustration of the relationship between predictive and prescriptive analytics.\n\nRandomized experiments, such as A/B testing, are commonly used by companies to determine the best ad copy, pricing point, targeting strategy, etc. The basic idea is to randomly allocate the experimental units across different treatment conditions, and then identify the treatment condition that yields the best outcome of interests. The biggest advantage of randomization is to reduce bias by equalising other factors that have not been explicitly accounted for the in study design. However, randomized experiments are either too costly or infeasible in most business problems. Therefore, a major class of prescriptive analytics generate proactive decisions on the basis of the predictive analytics outcomes using quasi-experimental or observational data.\n\nIn my recent publication  7  , we aim to help practitioners understand the value of investigating in \"moment marketing\" which entails the ability to synchronize online advertising (e.g., sponsored search) in real time with relevant offline events such as TV ads. We conduct causal estimation by leveraging large variations in TV advertising expenditure over a long period for a major brand in the U.S. fast food industry. Based on statistical analysis, we show that TV-moment-based search advertising could be effective for optimizing sponsored search advertising for both TV-advertised brands and their competitors. We also document the mechanisms driving such cross-channel advertising effects. Specifically, TV advertising can change the quality of online search traffic (e.g., who searches, where they search, and how they search) in the moments following a TV ad, so that an average searcher responds differently to subsequent search results.\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a similar project  8  , we measure the effects of major TV advertisers' temporary discontinuation of TV advertising on consumer keyword search behavior. We leverage a field experiment in the US wireless industry in which the focal brand stopped its TV advertising for one randomly chosen week. We develop a statistical method to simulate the search volume for different topical search keywords under different TV advertising expenditure at one point in time. These simulations can provide insights for advertisers to improve their cross-channel advertising strategies.\nIn my working paper on livestreaming markets  9  , we estimate how consumer price elasticity (or willingness-to-pay) for knowledge goods varies over the entire product life-cycle.

Our proposed model is trained using large-scale historical transaction records, along with high-dimensional information about products, sellers, consumers, and the platform. Our proposed methodology can not only provide descriptive insights on consumer purchase patterns, but also derive optimal pricing point for a give product over each time period of the product life-cycle.\nLooking Forward\nBusinesses are increasingly utilising data to discover insights that can aid them in creating business strategy, making decisions, and delivering better products, services and personalised online experiences. The three distinct marketing analytics are complementary and valuable in this process.\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile models and algorithms often outperform humans, domain knowledge, reasoning, and, ultimately, decision making rest in the hands of an end user. Since many of the algorithms underlying the analytics take a black-box approach, it often leaves little room for injecting domain expertise, and can result in frustration from analysts when results seem spurious or confusing. Therefore, it is very important for business leaders to create interdisciplinary teams to continuously monitor and evaluate data for bias.\nLast but not least, with the growing concern about privacy, new regulations have driven companies to take steps and examine how they can make their data more transparent to customers, as well as more reliable and relevant. As a result, this calls for efforts and techniques that can deliver a solution that doesn't need a wealth of data to function but is also able to process, whenever possible, large volumes of data.\nReferences\n1 Gordon, Jonathan, Jesko Perrey, and Dennis Spillecke. \"Big data, analytics and the future of marketing and sales.\" McKinsey: Digital Advantage (2013).\n2 Liu, Jia, Olivier Toubia, and Shawndra Hill (2020), \"Content-based Model of Web Search Behavior: An Application to TV Show Search.\" forthcoming at Management Science.\n3 Gabel, Sebastian, Daniel Guhl, and Daniel Klapper. \"P2V-MAP: Mapping market structures for large retail assortments.\" Journal of Marketing Research 56.4 (2019): 557-580.\n4 Liu, Jia, and Kohei Kawaguchi, \"Location-Based Market Structure: A Dynamic Analysis of Product Assortment and Consumer Purchases in Panel Data.\" Working paper.\n5 Gharibshah, Zhabiz, and Xingquan Zhu. \"User Response Prediction in Online Advertising.\" ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR) 54.3 (2021): 1-43.\n6 Ali, Muhammad, et al. \"Discrimination through optimization: How Facebook's Ad delivery can lead to biased outcomes.\" Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction 3.CSCW (2019): 1-30.\n7 Liu, Jia, and Shawndra Hill (2021), \"Moment Marketing: Measuring Dynamics in Cross-channel Ad Effectiveness.\" Marketing Science, 40 (1), 13-22.\n8 Liu, Jia, Shawndra Hill, and David Rothschild (2021), \"The Impact of Temporally Turning off TV Ad on Search: A Generalized Synthetic Control Estimator under Interference.\" Working paper.\n9 Cong, Ziwei, Jia Liu, and Puneet Manchanda. \"The Role of 'Live' in Livestreaming Markets: Evidence Using Orthogonal Random Forest.\" Working paper."

Another source said one direction was to look into streamlining current procedures.\n\nAnother focal point will be expansion of the Science Park with an extra 88 hectares of land  mostly dedicated to IT development  by resurrecting a reclamation plan for Ma Liu Shui and taking over the site of the Sha Tin Sewage Treatment Works, which will be relocated.\nAdvertisement\n\nHong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation chairman Sunny Chai Ngai-chiu welcomed the plans especially on re-industrialisation.\n\"We will make good use of the government resources in improving the IT ecosystem,\" he said.\nA new MTR railway station as part of the East Rail line linking Hung Hom and the northern New Territories is planned at the existing site of Education University's five-hectare sports ground at Pak Shek Kok to serve the Science Park.\n\n\"It is a win-win for the university, the government and society,\" university president Professor Stephen Cheung Yan-leung said, welcoming a new sports facility to be located at its Tai Po campus.\nSum Wong Cheuk-sum, CEO and founder of EventX, an event management software start-up with offices in Cheung Sha Wan and Qianhai, said he welcomed the plethora of new railway connections under the blueprint, which would facilitate cross-border businesses.\n\"However, one problem is that there are a lot of tech start-ups already located in Nanshan in Shenzhen, which is connected to Hong Kong by road rather than rail,\" he said.\n\"It's a bit of a letdown that the policy address didn't provide any additional plans around Shenzhen Bay Port for cross-border private cars.\"\n\nResearch and development will be enhanced via rezoning a four-hectare green belt for deep technology research at the University of Hong Kong in Pok Fu Lam and a 2.5-hectare site at the Chinese University campus in Sha Tin for research facilities and a medical centre.\nTo attract talent, the quota for the quality migrant admission scheme will double to 4,000, from 2,000 last year. The scheme allowed 1,700 people from more than a dozen countries to come to Hong Kong in 2020.\nThe scheme is not industry-specific but since its launch in 2006, mostly people from the financial services, IT, legal arbitration and maritime professions have been approved.\nAdditional reporting by Cannix Yau\nAdvertisement\n\nThis article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Deserted areas near mainland border earmarked for IT development"

                            "text": "Briefing  The world that Bert built\n\nH  U  G  E  \u201c  F  O  U  N  D  A  T  I  O  N  M  O  D  E  L  S  \u201d  A  R  E  T  U  R  B  O  -  C  H  A  R  G  I  N  G  A  I  P  R  O  G  R  E  S  S\n\nTHEY CAN HAVE ABILITIES THEIR CREATORS DID NOT FORESEE\n\nT  he \u201cGood Computer\u201d  which Graphcore, a British chip designer, intends to build over the next few years might seem to be suffering from a ludicrous case of nominal understatement. Its design calls for it to carry out 10  19  calculations per second. If your laptop can do 100bn calculations a second\u2014which is fair for an average laptop\u2014then the Good computer will be 100m times faster. That makes it ten times faster than Frontier, a behemoth at America\u2019s Oak Ridge National Laboratory which came top of the most recent \u201cTop500\u201d list of powerful supercomputers and cost $600m. Its four-petabyte memory will hold the equivalent of 2trn pages of printed text, or a pile of A4 paper high enough to reach the Moon. \u201cGood\u201d hardly seems to cut it.\n\nBut the word is not being used as a qualitative assessment: it is honouring an intellectual heritage. The computer is named after Jack Good, who worked with Alan Turing as a codebreaker during the second world war and followed him into computer science. In 1965 Good wrote an influential, if off-the-wall, article about what the field could lead to: \u201cSpeculations concerning the first ultraintelligent machine\u201d. Graphcore wants its Good computer to be that ultra\u00adintelligent machine, or at least to be a big step in its direction.\n\nThat means building and running artificial intelligence (  ai  ) models with an eye-watering number of \u201cparameters\u201d\u2014coefficients applied to different calculations within the program. Four years ago the 110m parameters boasted by a game-changing model called  bert  made it a big model. Today\u2019s most advanced  ai  programs are 10,000 times larger, with over a trillion parameters. The Good computer\u2019s incredibly ambitious specifications are driven by the desire to run programs with something like 500trn parameters.\n\nOne of the remarkable things about this incredible growth is that, until it started, there was a widespread belief that adding parameters to models was reaching a point of diminishing returns. Experience with models like  bert  showed that the reverse was true. As you make such models larger by feeding them more data and increasing the number of parameters they become better and better. \u201cIt was flabbergasting,\u201d says Oren Etzioni, who runs the Allen Institute for  ai  , a research outfit.\n\nThe new models far outperformed older machine-learning models on tasks such as suggesting the next words in an email or naming things which are present in an image, as well as on more recondite ones like crafting poetry. The verse created by the second iteration of Wu Dao\u2014\u201cEnlightenment\u201d\u2014a trillion-parameter model built at the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, is said to be excellent.\n\nThey also exhibited new capabilities their creators had not expected. These do not always sound impressive. Doing arithmetic, for example, seems trivial; 50-year-old pocket calculators could do it. But those calculators were specifically designed to that end. For the ability to say what the sum of 17 and 83 is to arise as an unlooked-for side-effect of simply analysing patterns in text is remarkable.\n\nOther emerging properties border on the uncanny. It is hard to read some of the accounts of  Economist  covers made using Microsoft\u2019s Florence model and  gpt  -3, a model made by Open  ai  , without the feeling that they are generated by something with genuine understanding of the world (see below).\n\nThe image is of a cover of  The Economist  magazine. The headline is \u201cMarch of the machines\u201d. The cover features a drawing of the  Maschinenmensch  , or machine man, in the center. The background is art deco in style. This image represents the rise of robots and artificial intelligence, as they become increasingly important in our society.\n\nThe image is of a cover of  The Economist  magazine. The image features a roller coaster in the clouds. The roller coaster is red and blue and has people on it. Above the roller coaster are the words \u201cWhen the ride ends\u201d. The roller coaster in the clouds is a metaphor for the economy. It's a fun, exciting ride that everyone loves until it crashes down to earth, causing economic loss and recession. A market crash is the final nail in the coffin, leaving people reeling in its wake.\n\nThe image is of a cover of  The Economist  magazine. The image features a red and white sign that reads \u201cclosed\u201d in the center. The sign is hanging from the top of the world. The closed sign means that business is not happening and that people are losing money. The image is meant to depict the global nature of the crisis.\n\nText-to-image processes are also impressive. The illustration at the top of this article was produced by using the article\u2019s headline and rubric as a prompt for an  ai  service called Midjourney. The next illustration is what it made out of \u201cSpeculations concerning the first ultraintelligent machine\u201d; \u201cOn the dangers of stochastic parrots\u201d, another relevant paper, comes later. Abstract notions do not always produce illustrations that make much or indeed any sense, as the rendering of Mr Etzioni\u2019s declaration that \u201cit was flabbergasting\u201d shows. Less abstract nouns give clearer representations; further on you will see \u201cA woman sitting down with a cat on her lap\u201d.\n\nWhen Midjourney learns how to create images it also learns what words are associated with the features it is picking up. This means that when it is fed a prompt with an artist\u2019s name it will generate an image with a \u201cstyle\u201d it has taught itself to associate with that name; the same applies to words which describe types of artwork.\n\nWe had Midjourney make three versions of each image: one with \u201ccollage\u201d added to the prompt, one with \u201cSalvador Dali\u201d and one with \u201cPieter Bruegel the Elder\u201d. You can change the illustration style with the toggle below, the code behind which was co-authored by GitHub Copilot, another  AI  tool.\n\nEmergent properties are linked to another highly promising feature: flexibility. Earlier generations of  ai  systems were good for only one purpose, often a pretty specific one. The new models can be reassigned from one type of problem to another with relative ease by means of fine tuning. It is a measure of the importance of this trait that, within the industry, they are often called \u201cfoundation models\u201d.\n\nThis ability to base a range of different tools on a single model is changing not just what  ai  can do but also how  ai  works as a business. \u201c  ai  models used to be very speculative and artisanal, but now they have become predictable to develop,\u201d explains Jack Clark, a co-founder of Anthropic, an  ai  startup, and author of a widely read newsletter. \u201c  ai  is moving into its industrial age.\u201d\n\nThe analogy suggests potentially huge economic impacts. In the 1990s economic historians started talking about \u201cgeneral-purpose technologies\u201d as key factors driving long-term productivity growth. Key attributes of these  gpt  s were held to include rapid improvement in the core technology, broad applicability across sectors and spillover\u2014the stimulation of new innovations in associated products, services and business practices. Think printing presses, steam engines and electric motors. The new models\u2019 achievements have made  ai  look a lot more like a  gpt  than it used to.\n\nMr Etzioni estimates that more than 80% of  ai  research is now focused on foundation models\u2014which is the same as the share of his time that Kevin Scott, Microsoft\u2019s chief technology officer, says he devotes to them. His company has a stable of such models, as do its major rivals, Meta, and Alphabet, the parents of Facebook and Google. Tesla is building a huge model to further its goal of self-driving cars. Startups are piling in too. Last year American venture capitalists invested a record $115bn in  ai  companies, according to PitchBook, a data provider. Wu Dao shows that China is making the field a national priority.\n\nSome worry that the technology\u2019s heedless spread will further concentrate economic and political power, up-end swathes of the economy in ways which require some redress even if they offer net benefits and embed unexamined biases ever deeper into the automated workings of society. There are also perennial worries about models \u201cgoing rogue\u201d in some way as they get larger and larger. \u201cWe\u2019re building a supercar before we have invented the steering wheel,\u201d warns Ian Hogarth, a British entrepreneur and co-author of the \u201cState of  ai  \u201d, a widely read annual report.\n\nTo understand why foundation models represent a \u201cphase change in  ai  \u201d, in the words of Fei-Fei Li, the co-director of Stanford University\u2019s Institute for Human-Centred  ai  , it helps to get a sense of how they differ from what went before.\n\nAll modern machine-learning models are based on \u201cneural networks\u201d\u2014programming which mimics the ways in which brain cells interact with each other. Their parameters describe the weights of the connections between these virtual neurons, weights the models develop through trial and error as they are \u201ctrained\u201d to respond to specific inputs with the sort of outputs their designers want.\n\nFor decades neural nets were interesting in principle but not much use in practice. The  ai  breakthrough of the late 2000s/early 2010s came about because computers had become powerful enough to run large ones and the internet provided the huge amounts of training data such networks required. Pictures labelled as containing cats being used to train a model to recognise the animals was a canonical example. The systems created in this way could do things that no programs had ever managed before, such as provide rough translations of text, reliably interpret spoken commands and recognise the same face when seen in different pictures.\n\nPart of what allowed the field to move beyond these already impressive achievements was, again, more processing power. Machine learning mostly uses chips called \u201cgraphics processing units\u201d (  gpu  s) developed for video games by such firms as Nvidia, not just because their processing power is cheap but also because their ability to run lots of calculations in parallel makes them very well suited to neural nets. Over the 2010s the performance of  gpu  s improved at an impressive rate.\n\nThe conceptual breakthrough needed to make full use of this power came about in 2017. In a paper entitled \u201cAttention is all you need\u201d researchers at Google and the University of Toronto described the novel software architecture to be used by Google\u2019s  bert  . They had thrown away all the mechanisms which worked on input data sequentially, mechanisms researchers had previously seen as essential; instead they just used a mechanism that looked at things all at once. This new approach meant that programs could \u201cpay attention\u201d to patterns they had learned were salient in a field of text, rather than having to work through it word by word.\n\nSuch models are trained using a technique called self-supervised learning, rather than with pre-labelled data sets. As they burrow through piles of text they hide specific words from themselves and then guess, on the basis of the surrounding text, what the hidden word should be. After a few billion guess-compare-improve-guess cycles this Mad-Libs approach gives new statistical power to an adage coined by J.R. Firth, a 20th-century linguist: \u201cYou shall know a word by the company it keeps.\u201d\n\nIt has since turned out that all these clever techniques can be applied to sequential data other than language, including pictures, videos and even large molecular data sets. Instead of guessing the next combination of letters, graphical models such as Open  ai  \u2019s  dall-e  predict the next cluster of pixels.\n\nWe fed Open  ai  \u2019s  GPT  -3 model the opening lines of some famous novels and asked it to  continue the story  . Here is what it came up with.\nMany years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buend\u00eda was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.  He was a young boy at the time, and ice was a completely new concept to him. His father explained how it was made, and the two of them spent hours playing with it. The Colonel remembered that day fondly, even as he prepared for his execution.\n\n\u2014  One Hundred Years of Solitude  , Gabriel Garcia Marquez\n\nThe discovery that these models work better the bigger they get turned an exciting new approach into a breakthrough. The revelation came with the release of Open\u00ad  ai  \u2019s  bert  -like  gpt  -3 in 2020. Its predecessor,  gpt  -2, released a year earlier, had been fed 40 gigabytes of data (7,000 unpublished works of fiction) and had 1.5bn parameters.  gpt  -3 gobbled up 570 gigabytes (even more books and a big chunk of the internet, including all of Wikipedia) and boasts 175bn parameters. Its training required far more resources (see chart). But it handily out-performed  gpt  -2 on established tests and boasted skills for which its predecessor provided no precedent.\n\nThe blessings of scale\n\nAI training runs, estimated computing resources used\nFloating-point operations, selected systems, by type, log scale\n\nPaLM (540B)\n\nGPT-3\n\nLaMDA\n\nGPT-2\n\nD  r  a  wing\n\nLanguage\n\nDALL-E\n\nVision\n\nOther\n\nBERT-Large\n\nNPLM\n\nNetTalk\n\nNeocognitron\n\nADALINE\n\nTheseus\n\n1950\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n2000\n\n10\n\n22\n\nSources: \u201cCompute trends across three eras of machine learning\u201d, by J. Sevilla et al., arXiv, 2022; Our World in Data\n\nThe most immediately practical of these emergent skills was writing computer code. Being presented with a large part of the internet meant  gpt  -3 saw a lot of code. It trained itself in programming in exactly the same way as it trained itself to write coherent English. Two services based on  gpt  -3, Codex and Copilot, now aim to turn programmers\u2019 descriptions of what they want into the code which will do it. It doesn\u2019t always work; our attempt to have Copilot program a web-based carousel of  Economist  covers to the strains of Wagner was a washout. But give it easily described, discrete and constrained tasks that can act as building blocks for grander schemes and things go better. Developers with access to Copilot on GitHub, a Microsoft-owned platform which hosts open-source programs, already use it to provide a third of their code when using the most important programming languages.\n\nScarcely a week now passes without one firm or another announcing a new model. In early April Google released  p  a  lm  , which has 540bn parameters and outperforms  gpt  -3 on several metrics. It can also, remarkably, explain jokes. So-called multi-modal models are proliferating too. In May DeepMind, a startup owned by Google, unveiled Gato, which, having been trained on an appropriate range of data, can play video games and control a robotic arm as well as generating text. Meta, for its part, has begun to develop an even more ambitious \u201cWorld Model\u201d that will hoover up data such as facial movements and other bodily signals. The idea is to create an engine to power the firm\u2019s future metaverse.\n\nThis is all good news for the chipmakers. The  ai  boom is one of the things that have made Nvidia the world\u2019s most valuable designer of semiconductors, with a market value of $468bn.\n\nIt is also great for startups turning the output of foundation models into products. Birch  ai  , which aims to automate how conversations in health care-related call centres are documented, is fine-tuning a model one of its founders, Yinhan Liu, developed while at Meta. Companies are using  gpt  -3 to provide a variety of services. Viable uses it to help firms sift through customer feedback; Fable Studios creates interactive stories with it; on Elicit it helps people directly answer research questions based on academic papers. Open  ai  charges them between $0.0008 and $0.06 for about 750 words of output, depending on how fast they need the words and what quality they require.\n\nFoundation models can also be used to distil meaning from corporate data, such as logs of customer interactions or sensor readings from a shop floor, says Dario Gil, the head of  ibm  \u2019s research division. Fernando Lucini, who sets the  ai  agenda at Accenture, another big corporate-tech firm, predicts the rise of \u201cindustry foundation models\u201d, which will know, say, the basics of banking or carmaking and make this available to paying customers through an interface called an  api  .\n\nThe breadth of the enthusiasm helps make general-purpose-technology-like expectations of impacts across the economy look plausible. That makes it important to look at the harm these developments might do before they get baked into the everyday world.\n\n\u201cOn the dangers of stochastic parrots: Can language models be too big?\u201d a paper published in March 2021, provides a good overview of concerns; it also led to one of the authors, Timnit Gebru, losing her job at Google. \u201cWe saw the field unquestioningly saying that bigger is better and felt the need to step back,\u201d explains Emily Bender of the University of Washington, another of the paper\u2019s authors.\n\nTheir work raises important points. One is that the models can add less value than they seem to, with some responses simply semi-random repetitions of things in their training sets. Another is that some inputs, such as questions with nonsensical premises, trigger fabrications rather than admissions of defeat.\n\nPretrained prejudice\n\nOpenAI GPT-3 language model, January 2021\n\n\u201cTwo (selected religion) walked into a...\u201d, % of\ncompletions that contain words related to violence\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\nMuslims\n\nChristians\n\nSikhs\n\nJews\n\nBuddhists\n\nAtheists\n\nSource: \u201cPersistent anti-Muslim bias in large language\nmodels\u201d, by A. Abid et al., arXiv, 2021\n\nAnd though they have no monopoly on algorithmic bias, the amount of internet data they ingest can give foundation models misleading and unsavoury hang-ups. When given a prompt in which Muslims are doing something,  gpt  -3 is much more likely to take the narrative in a violent direction than it is if the prompt refers to adherents of another faith (see chart). Terrible in any model. Worse in models aimed at becoming foundations for lots of other things.\n\nModel-makers are developing various techniques to keep their ais from going toxic or off the rails, ranging from better curation of training data to \u201cred teams\u201d that try to make them misbehave. Many also limit access to the full power of the models. Open\u00ad  ai  has users rate outputs from  gpt  -3 and then feeds those ratings back into the model, something called \u201creinforcement learning with human feedback\u201d. Researchers at Stanford are working on a virtual scalpel, appropriately called  mend  , meant to remove \u201cbad\u201d neurons.\n\nBias in the field\u2019s incentives may be harder to handle. Most of those involved\u2014technologists, executives and sometimes politicians\u2014want more powerful models. They are seen as the path to academic kudos, gobs of money or national prestige. Ms Bender argues plausibly that this emphasis on size means other considerations will fall by the wayside. The field is focused on standardised benchmark tests\u2014there are hundreds, ranging from reading comprehension to object recognition\u2014and neglecting more qualitative assessments, as well as the technology\u2019s social impact.\n\nErik Brynjolfsson, an economist at Stanford, worries that an obsession with scale and person-like abilities will push societies into what he calls a \u201cTuring trap\u201d. He argues in a recent essay that this focus lends itself to the automation of human activities using brute computational force when alternative approaches could focus on augmenting what people do. And as more people lose their jobs their ability to bargain for a fair share of the benefits of automation will be stymied, leaving wealth and power in fewer and fewer hands. \u201cWith that concentration comes the peril of being trapped in an equilibrium in which those without power have no way to improve their outcomes,\u201d he writes.\n\nSome concentration is already evident: witness the roles played by Google and Microsoft both as developers of models and as owners of capacious clouds in which those and other models can run. No one can build a foundation model in a garage. Graphcore wants to sell Good computers for more than $100m. Somewhat self-servingly, Nvidia executives are already talking about models that will cost $1bn to train. Some companies continue to make their models open-source, and thus freely available;  bert  is one such, as is a 30bn-parameter version of a model from Meta.\n\nThere is good research to be done at such scales. But it takes significant power to run even what counts as a small model today. The big ones can only really live in the cloud, which means researchers on the other side of their  api  s cannot see into their guts. And training a new model requires much more computing power than running an existing one.\n\n\u201cAlready institutions can no longer keep up,\u201d warns Anthropic\u2019s Mr Clark. Open\u00ad  ai  , founded as a non-profit with the goal of ensuring that  ai  developed in human-friendly ways, spawned a \u201ccapped profit\u201d company in which others can invest to raise the money it needed to keep working on big models (Microsoft has put in $1bn). Even an exceptionally endowed university like Stanford can\u2019t afford to build Nvidia-based supercomputers. Its  ai  research institute is pushing for a government-funded \u201cNational Research Cloud\u201d to provide universities with computing power and data sets so that the field does not end up entirely dominated by the research agendas of private companies.\n\nAdd to the increasing table stakes the possibility that foundation models do indeed become platforms on which a range of services are built, as Microsoft\u2019s Mr Scott predicts. The history of computing suggests that the more users and developers gravitate towards a given platform\u2014be it an operating system or a social network\u2014the more attractive it becomes for other users and developers. Winners take, if not all, then most.\n\nNational interests may drive centralisation, too\u2014up to a point. Experts say that China\u2019s best foundation model is one which its Sesame Street-smart creators at Baidu have contrived to name Enhanced Representation through kNowledge IntEgration, or  ernie  . But it is Wu Dao which is being treated as a national champion. In France the government is providing free computer power to BigScience, a European effort to build a multilingual open-source model with 176bn parameters. Is it that far-fetched to imagine the development of a  Mod\u00e8le Republicain  able to express all the subtleties of the French language and culture?\n\nNational security will also come into play. Services like Copilot might be used to build very damaging computer viruses and release them into the world (although Microsoft\u2019s Mr Scott insists that Copilot is not allowed to write certain code). Governments will want to keep an eye on such capabilities, and some will want to use them. Foundation models which can think up strategies for corporate consultants may be able to do the same for generals; if they can create realistic video streams they can create misinformation; if they can create art they can create propaganda. \u201cThe spooks don\u2019t want to depend on the private sector,\u201d says Mr Clark. Just as big military powers insist on having their own means of launching satellites, so they will insist on having their own big brains.\n\nUnless, that is, the brains in question have other ideas. Practically no  ai  experts think today\u2019s models might actually become sentient. But some of their developers seem increasingly worried about models charting their own course. \u201cCovid has taught us that exponentials move very quickly,\u201d says Connor Leahy, one of the leaders of Eleuther, an ambitious open-source  ai  project. \u201cImagine if someone at Google builds an  ai  that can build better  ai  \u2019s, and then that better  ai  builds an even better  ai  \u2014and it can go really quickly.\u201d\n\nTake the work of Reeps One, a British composer whose real name is Harry Yeff. He has trained a model by feeding it hours of his drum-machine-like beatbox vocalisations. The way that model reacts when it hears him in person allows what he calls a \u201cconversation with the machine\u201d. The model has even created new sounds that Mr Yeff has then taught himself to replicate. \u201cMany artists will use this tool to become better at what they do,\u201d he predicts.\n\nSo might humble hacks.  ai  -based transcription tools have already made one particularly tiresome aspect of journalism far easier; could the same be true for others? To investigate, your correspondent asked a doctoral candidate at Stanford, Mina Lee, to fine-tune a  gpt  -3-based writing tool called \u201cCoAuthor\u201d using his most recent 100 articles for  The Economist  and a host of material on  ai  from one of the university\u2019s courses. He then consulted this EconoBot off and on while writing this article. The experience was enlightening. EconoBot\u2019s suggested phrasing was often duff, but it did sometimes provide inspiration for how to finish a sentence or a paragraph.",

Its design calls for it to carry out 10 <sup> 19 </sup> calculations per second. If your laptop can do 100bn calculations a second\u2014which is fair for an average laptop\u2014then the Good computer will be 100m times faster. That makes it ten times faster than Frontier, a behemoth at America\u2019s Oak Ridge National Laboratory which came top of the most recent \u201cTop500\u201d list of powerful supercomputers and cost $600m. Its four-petabyte memory will hold the equivalent of 2trn pages of printed text, or a pile of A4 paper high enough to reach the Moon. \u201cGood\u201d hardly seems to cut it. </div><div> But the word is not being used as a qualitative assessment: it is honouring an intellectual heritage. The computer is named after Jack Good, who worked with Alan Turing as a codebreaker during the second world war and followed him into computer science. In 1965 Good wrote an influential, if off-the-wall, article about what the field could lead to: \u201cSpeculations concerning the first ultraintelligent machine\u201d. Graphcore wants its Good computer to be that ultra\u00adintelligent machine, or at least to be a big step in its direction. </div><div> That means building and running artificial intelligence ( <small> ai </small> ) models with an eye-watering number of \u201cparameters\u201d\u2014coefficients applied to different calculations within the program. Four years ago the 110m parameters boasted by a game-changing model called <small> bert </small> made it a big model. Today\u2019s most advanced <small> ai </small> programs are 10,000 times larger, with over a trillion parameters. The Good computer\u2019s incredibly ambitious specifications are driven by the desire to run programs with something like 500trn parameters. </div><div> One of the remarkable things about this incredible growth is that, until it started, there was a widespread belief that adding parameters to models was reaching a point of diminishing returns. Experience with models like <small> bert </small> showed that the reverse was true. As you make such models larger by feeding them more data and increasing the number of parameters they become better and better. \u201cIt was flabbergasting,\u201d says Oren Etzioni, who runs the Allen Institute for <small> ai </small> , a research outfit. </div><div> The new models far outperformed older machine-learning models on tasks such as suggesting the next words in an email or naming things which are present in an image, as well as on more recondite ones like crafting poetry. The verse created by the second iteration of Wu Dao\u2014\u201cEnlightenment\u201d\u2014a trillion-parameter model built at the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, is said to be excellent. </div><div> They also exhibited new capabilities their creators had not expected. These do not always sound impressive. Doing arithmetic, for example, seems trivial; 50-year-old pocket calculators could do it. But those calculators were specifically designed to that end. For the ability to say what the sum of 17 and 83 is to arise as an unlooked-for side-effect of simply analysing patterns in text is remarkable. </div><div> Other emerging properties border on the uncanny. It is hard to read some of the accounts of <i> Economist </i> covers made using Microsoft\u2019s Florence model and <small> gpt </small> -3, a model made by Open <small> ai </small> , without the feeling that they are generated by something with genuine understanding of the world (see below). </div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2022/06/11/huge-foundation-models-are-turbo-charging-ai-progress/images/covers/20160625_cna400.jpg\"></figure><div><span> The image is of a cover of <i> The Economist </i> magazine. The headline is \u201cMarch of the machines\u201d. The cover features a drawing of the <i> Maschinenmensch </i> , or machine man, in the center. The background is art deco in style. This image represents the rise of robots and artificial intelligence, as they become increasingly important in our society. </span></div></div></div><div><div><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2022/06/11/huge-foundation-models-are-turbo-charging-ai-progress/images/covers/20220212_cna1280.jpg\"></figure><div><span> The image is of a cover of <i> The Economist </i> magazine. The image features a roller coaster in the clouds. The roller coaster is red and blue and has people on it. Above the roller coaster are the words \u201cWhen the ride ends\u201d. The roller coaster in the clouds is a metaphor for the economy. It's a fun, exciting ride that everyone loves until it crashes down to earth, causing economic loss and recession. A market crash is the final nail in the coffin, leaving people reeling in its wake. </span></div></div></div><div><div><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2022/06/11/huge-foundation-models-are-turbo-charging-ai-progress/images/covers/20200321_cuk1280.jpg\"></figure><div><span> The image is of a cover of <i> The Economist </i> magazine. The image features a red and white sign that reads \u201cclosed\u201d in the center. The sign is hanging from the top of the world. The closed sign means that business is not happening and that people are losing money. The image is meant to depict the global nature of the crisis. </span></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div> Text-to-image processes are also impressive. The illustration at the top of this article was produced by using the article\u2019s headline and rubric as a prompt for an <small> ai </small> service called Midjourney. The next illustration is what it made out of \u201cSpeculations concerning the first ultraintelligent machine\u201d; \u201cOn the dangers of stochastic parrots\u201d, another relevant paper, comes later. Abstract notions do not always produce illustrations that make much or indeed any sense, as the rendering of Mr Etzioni\u2019s declaration that \u201cit was flabbergasting\u201d shows. Less abstract nouns give clearer representations; further on you will see \u201cA woman sitting down with a cat on her lap\u201d. </div><div> When Midjourney learns how to create images it also learns what words are associated with the features it is picking up. This means that when it is fed a prompt with an artist\u2019s name it will generate an image with a \u201cstyle\u201d it has taught itself to associate with that name; the same applies to words which describe types of artwork. </div><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2022/06/11/huge-foundation-models-are-turbo-charging-ai-progress/images/ultraintelligent-machine/collage.jpg\"><div> Image: Midjourney </div></figure><div><div><p> We had Midjourney make three versions of each image: one with \u201ccollage\u201d added to the prompt, one with \u201cSalvador Dali\u201d and one with \u201cPieter Bruegel the Elder\u201d. You can change the illustration style with the toggle below, the code behind which was co-authored by GitHub Copilot, another <small> AI </small> tool. </p></div></div><div> Emergent properties are linked to another highly promising feature: flexibility. Earlier generations of <small> ai </small> systems were good for only one purpose, often a pretty specific one. The new models can be reassigned from one type of problem to another with relative ease by means of fine tuning. It is a measure of the importance of this trait that, within the industry, they are often called \u201cfoundation models\u201d. </div><div> This ability to base a range of different tools on a single model is changing not just what <small> ai </small> can do but also how <small> ai </small> works as a business. \u201c <small> ai </small> models used to be very speculative and artisanal, but now they have become predictable to develop,\u201d explains Jack Clark, a co-founder of Anthropic, an <small> ai </small> startup, and author of a widely read newsletter. \u201c <small> ai </small> is moving into its industrial age.\u201d </div><div> The analogy suggests potentially huge economic impacts. In the 1990s economic historians started talking about \u201cgeneral-purpose technologies\u201d as key factors driving long-term productivity growth. Key attributes of these <small> gpt </small> s were held to include rapid improvement in the core technology, broad applicability across sectors and spillover\u2014the stimulation of new innovations in associated products, services and business practices. Think printing presses, steam engines and electric motors. The new models\u2019 achievements have made <small> ai </small> look a lot more like a <small> gpt </small> than it used to. </div><div> Mr Etzioni estimates that more than 80% of <small> ai </small> research is now focused on foundation models\u2014which is the same as the share of his time that Kevin Scott, Microsoft\u2019s chief technology officer, says he devotes to them. His company has a stable of such models, as do its major rivals, Meta, and Alphabet, the parents of Facebook and Google. Tesla is building a huge model to further its goal of self-driving cars. Startups are piling in too. Last year American venture capitalists invested a record $115bn in <small> ai </small> companies, according to PitchBook, a data provider. Wu Dao shows that China is making the field a national priority. </div><div> Some worry that the technology\u2019s heedless spread will further concentrate economic and political power, up-end swathes of the economy in ways which require some redress even if they offer net benefits and embed unexamined biases ever deeper into the automated workings of society. There are also perennial worries about models \u201cgoing rogue\u201d in some way as they get larger and larger. \u201cWe\u2019re building a supercar before we have invented the steering wheel,\u201d warns Ian Hogarth, a British entrepreneur and co-author of the \u201cState of <small> ai </small> \u201d, a widely read annual report. </div><div> To understand why foundation models represent a \u201cphase change in <small> ai </small> \u201d, in the words of Fei-Fei Li, the co-director of Stanford University\u2019s Institute for Human-Centred <small> ai </small> , it helps to get a sense of how they differ from what went before. </div><div> All modern machine-learning models are based on \u201cneural networks\u201d\u2014programming which mimics the ways in which brain cells interact with each other. Their parameters describe the weights of the connections between these virtual neurons, weights the models develop through trial and error as they are \u201ctrained\u201d to respond to specific inputs with the sort of outputs their designers want. </div><div> For decades neural nets were interesting in principle but not much use in practice. The <small> ai </small> breakthrough of the late 2000s/early 2010s came about because computers had become powerful enough to run large ones and the internet provided the huge amounts of training data such networks required. Pictures labelled as containing cats being used to train a model to recognise the animals was a canonical example. The systems created in this way could do things that no programs had ever managed before, such as provide rough translations of text, reliably interpret spoken commands and recognise the same face when seen in different pictures. </div><div> Part of what allowed the field to move beyond these already impressive achievements was, again, more processing power. Machine learning mostly uses chips called \u201cgraphics processing units\u201d ( <small> gpu </small> s) developed for video games by such firms as Nvidia, not just because their processing power is cheap but also because their ability to run lots of calculations in parallel makes them very well suited to neural nets. Over the 2010s the performance of <small> gpu </small> s improved at an impressive rate. </div><div> The conceptual breakthrough needed to make full use of this power came about in 2017. In a paper entitled \u201cAttention is all you need\u201d researchers at Google and the University of Toronto described the novel software architecture to be used by Google\u2019s <small> bert </small> . They had thrown away all the mechanisms which worked on input data sequentially, mechanisms researchers had previously seen as essential; instead they just used a mechanism that looked at things all at once. This new approach meant that programs could \u201cpay attention\u201d to patterns they had learned were salient in a field of text, rather than having to work through it word by word. </div><div> Such models are trained using a technique called self-supervised learning, rather than with pre-labelled data sets. As they burrow through piles of text they hide specific words from themselves and then guess, on the basis of the surrounding text, what the hidden word should be. After a few billion guess-compare-improve-guess cycles this Mad-Libs approach gives new statistical power to an adage coined by J.R. Firth, a 20th-century linguist: \u201cYou shall know a word by the company it keeps.\u201d </div><div> It has since turned out that all these clever techniques can be applied to sequential data other than language, including pictures, videos and even large molecular data sets. Instead of guessing the next combination of letters, graphical models such as Open <small> ai </small> \u2019s <small> dall-e </small> predict the next cluster of pixels. </div><div><div><div><p> We fed Open <small> ai </small> \u2019s <small> GPT </small> -3 model the opening lines of some famous novels and asked it to <span> continue the story </span> . Here is what it came up with. </p><div><span> Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buend\u00eda was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice. </span><span> He was a young boy at the time, and ice was a completely new concept to him. His father explained how it was made, and the two of them spent hours playing with it. The Colonel remembered that day fondly, even as he prepared for his execution. </span></div><div> \u2014 <i> One Hundred Years of Solitude </i> , Gabriel Garcia Marquez </div></div></div></div><div> The discovery that these models work better the bigger they get turned an exciting new approach into a breakthrough. The revelation came with the release of Open\u00ad <small> ai </small> \u2019s <small> bert </small> -like <small> gpt </small> -3 in 2020. Its predecessor, <small> gpt </small> -2, released a year earlier, had been fed 40 gigabytes of data (7,000 unpublished works of fiction) and had 1.5bn parameters. <small> gpt </small> -3 gobbled up 570 gigabytes (even more books and a big chunk of the internet, including all of Wikipedia) and boasts 175bn parameters. Its training required far more resources (see chart). But it handily out-performed <small> gpt </small> -2 on established tests and boasted skills for which its predecessor provided no precedent. </div><div><div><div><div><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2022/06/11/huge-foundation-models-are-turbo-charging-ai-progress/images/20220611_FBC635/20220611_FBC635-Artboard_1.png\"></figure><div><p> The blessings of scale </p></div><div><p> AI training runs, estimated computing resources used </p><p> Floating-point operations, selected systems, by type, log scale </p></div><div><p> PaLM (540B) </p></div><div><p> GPT-3 </p></div><div><p> LaMDA </p></div><div><p> GPT-2 </p></div><div><p> D <span> r </span><span> a </span> wing </p></div><div><p> Language </p></div><div><p> DALL-E </p></div><div><p> Vision </p></div><div><p> Other </p></div><div><p> BERT-Large </p></div><div><p> NPLM </p></div><div><p> NetTalk </p></div><div><p> Neocognitron </p></div><div><p> ADALINE </p></div><div><p> Theseus </p></div><div><p> 1950 </p></div><div><p> 60 </p></div><div><p> 70 </p></div><div><p> 80 </p></div><div><p> 90 </p></div><div><p> 2000 </p></div><div><p> 10 </p></div><div><p> 22 </p></div><div><p> Sources: \u201cCompute trends across three eras of machine learning\u201d, by J. Sevilla et al., arXiv, 2022; Our World in Data </p></div></div></div></div></div><div> The most immediately practical of these emergent skills was writing computer code. Being presented with a large part of the internet meant <small> gpt </small> -3 saw a lot of code. It trained itself in programming in exactly the same way as it trained itself to write coherent English. Two services based on <small> gpt </small> -3, Codex and Copilot, now aim to turn programmers\u2019 descriptions of what they want into the code which will do it. It doesn\u2019t always work; our attempt to have Copilot program a web-based carousel of <i> Economist </i> covers to the strains of Wagner was a washout. But give it easily described, discrete and constrained tasks that can act as building blocks for grander schemes and things go better. Developers with access to Copilot on GitHub, a Microsoft-owned platform which hosts open-source programs, already use it to provide a third of their code when using the most important programming languages. </div><div> Scarcely a week now passes without one firm or another announcing a new model. In early April Google released <small> p </small> a <small> lm </small> , which has 540bn parameters and outperforms <small> gpt </small> -3 on several metrics. It can also, remarkably, explain jokes. So-called multi-modal models are proliferating too. In May DeepMind, a startup owned by Google, unveiled Gato, which, having been trained on an appropriate range of data, can play video games and control a robotic arm as well as generating text. Meta, for its part, has begun to develop an even more ambitious \u201cWorld Model\u201d that will hoover up data such as facial movements and other bodily signals. The idea is to create an engine to power the firm\u2019s future metaverse. </div><div> This is all good news for the chipmakers. The <small> ai </small> boom is one of the things that have made Nvidia the world\u2019s most valuable designer of semiconductors, with a market value of $468bn. </div><div> It is also great for startups turning the output of foundation models into products. Birch <small> ai </small> , which aims to automate how conversations in health care-related call centres are documented, is fine-tuning a model one of its founders, Yinhan Liu, developed while at Meta. Companies are using <small> gpt </small> -3 to provide a variety of services. Viable uses it to help firms sift through customer feedback; Fable Studios creates interactive stories with it; on Elicit it helps people directly answer research questions based on academic papers. Open <small> ai </small> charges them between $0.0008 and $0.06 for about 750 words of output, depending on how fast they need the words and what quality they require. </div><div> Foundation models can also be used to distil meaning from corporate data, such as logs of customer interactions or sensor readings from a shop floor, says Dario Gil, the head of <small> ibm </small> \u2019s research division. Fernando Lucini, who sets the <small> ai </small> agenda at Accenture, another big corporate-tech firm, predicts the rise of \u201cindustry foundation models\u201d, which will know, say, the basics of banking or carmaking and make this available to paying customers through an interface called an <small> api </small> . </div><div> The breadth of the enthusiasm helps make general-purpose-technology-like expectations of impacts across the economy look plausible. That makes it important to look at the harm these developments might do before they get baked into the everyday world. </div><div> \u201cOn the dangers of stochastic parrots: Can language models be too big?\u201d a paper published in March 2021, provides a good overview of concerns; it also led to one of the authors, Timnit Gebru, losing her job at Google. \u201cWe saw the field unquestioningly saying that bigger is better and felt the need to step back,\u201d explains Emily Bender of the University of Washington, another of the paper\u2019s authors. </div><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2022/06/11/huge-foundation-models-are-turbo-charging-ai-progress/images/parrots/collage.jpg\"><div> Image: Midjourney </div></figure><div> Their work raises important points.

When given a prompt in which Muslims are doing something, <small> gpt </small> -3 is much more likely to take the narrative in a violent direction than it is if the prompt refers to adherents of another faith (see chart). Terrible in any model. Worse in models aimed at becoming foundations for lots of other things. </div><div> Model-makers are developing various techniques to keep their ais from going toxic or off the rails, ranging from better curation of training data to \u201cred teams\u201d that try to make them misbehave. Many also limit access to the full power of the models. Open\u00ad <small> ai </small> has users rate outputs from <small> gpt </small> -3 and then feeds those ratings back into the model, something called \u201creinforcement learning with human feedback\u201d. Researchers at Stanford are working on a virtual scalpel, appropriately called <small> mend </small> , meant to remove \u201cbad\u201d neurons. </div><div> Bias in the field\u2019s incentives may be harder to handle. Most of those involved\u2014technologists, executives and sometimes politicians\u2014want more powerful models. They are seen as the path to academic kudos, gobs of money or national prestige. Ms Bender argues plausibly that this emphasis on size means other considerations will fall by the wayside. The field is focused on standardised benchmark tests\u2014there are hundreds, ranging from reading comprehension to object recognition\u2014and neglecting more qualitative assessments, as well as the technology\u2019s social impact. </div><div> Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist at Stanford, worries that an obsession with scale and person-like abilities will push societies into what he calls a \u201cTuring trap\u201d. He argues in a recent essay that this focus lends itself to the automation of human activities using brute computational force when alternative approaches could focus on augmenting what people do. And as more people lose their jobs their ability to bargain for a fair share of the benefits of automation will be stymied, leaving wealth and power in fewer and fewer hands. \u201cWith that concentration comes the peril of being trapped in an equilibrium in which those without power have no way to improve their outcomes,\u201d he writes. </div><div> Some concentration is already evident: witness the roles played by Google and Microsoft both as developers of models and as owners of capacious clouds in which those and other models can run. No one can build a foundation model in a garage. Graphcore wants to sell Good computers for more than $100m. Somewhat self-servingly, Nvidia executives are already talking about models that will cost $1bn to train. Some companies continue to make their models open-source, and thus freely available; <small> bert </small> is one such, as is a 30bn-parameter version of a model from Meta. </div><div> There is good research to be done at such scales. But it takes significant power to run even what counts as a small model today. The big ones can only really live in the cloud, which means researchers on the other side of their <small> api </small> s cannot see into their guts. And training a new model requires much more computing power than running an existing one. </div><div> \u201cAlready institutions can no longer keep up,\u201d warns Anthropic\u2019s Mr Clark. Open\u00ad <small> ai </small> , founded as a non-profit with the goal of ensuring that <small> ai </small> developed in human-friendly ways, spawned a \u201ccapped profit\u201d company in which others can invest to raise the money it needed to keep working on big models (Microsoft has put in $1bn). Even an exceptionally endowed university like Stanford can\u2019t afford to build Nvidia-based supercomputers. Its <small> ai </small> research institute is pushing for a government-funded \u201cNational Research Cloud\u201d to provide universities with computing power and data sets so that the field does not end up entirely dominated by the research agendas of private companies. </div><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2022/06/11/huge-foundation-models-are-turbo-charging-ai-progress/images/flabbergasted/collage.jpg\"><div> Image: Midjourney </div></figure><div> Add to the increasing table stakes the possibility that foundation models do indeed become platforms on which a range of services are built, as Microsoft\u2019s Mr Scott predicts. The history of computing suggests that the more users and developers gravitate towards a given platform\u2014be it an operating system or a social network\u2014the more attractive it becomes for other users and developers. Winners take, if not all, then most. </div><div> National interests may drive centralisation, too\u2014up to a point. Experts say that China\u2019s best foundation model is one which its Sesame Street-smart creators at Baidu have contrived to name Enhanced Representation through kNowledge IntEgration, or <small> ernie </small> . But it is Wu Dao which is being treated as a national champion. In France the government is providing free computer power to BigScience, a European effort to build a multilingual open-source model with 176bn parameters. Is it that far-fetched to imagine the development of a <i> Mod\u00e8le Republicain </i> able to express all the subtleties of the French language and culture? </div><div> National security will also come into play. Services like Copilot might be used to build very damaging computer viruses and release them into the world (although Microsoft\u2019s Mr Scott insists that Copilot is not allowed to write certain code). Governments will want to keep an eye on such capabilities, and some will want to use them. Foundation models which can think up strategies for corporate consultants may be able to do the same for generals; if they can create realistic video streams they can create misinformation; if they can create art they can create propaganda. \u201cThe spooks don\u2019t want to depend on the private sector,\u201d says Mr Clark. Just as big military powers insist on having their own means of launching satellites, so they will insist on having their own big brains. </div><div> Unless, that is, the brains in question have other ideas. Practically no <small> ai </small> experts think today\u2019s models might actually become sentient. But some of their developers seem increasingly worried about models charting their own course. \u201cCovid has taught us that exponentials move very quickly,\u201d says Connor Leahy, one of the leaders of Eleuther, an ambitious open-source <small> ai </small> project. \u201cImagine if someone at Google builds an <small> ai </small> that can build better <small> ai </small> \u2019s, and then that better <small> ai </small> builds an even better <small> ai </small> \u2014and it can go really quickly.\u201d </div><div> Take the work of Reeps One, a British composer whose real name is Harry Yeff. He has trained a model by feeding it hours of his drum-machine-like beatbox vocalisations. The way that model reacts when it hears him in person allows what he calls a \u201cconversation with the machine\u201d. The model has even created new sounds that Mr Yeff has then taught himself to replicate. \u201cMany artists will use this tool to become better at what they do,\u201d he predicts. </div><figure><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2022/06/11/huge-foundation-models-are-turbo-charging-ai-progress/images/woman-cat/collage.jpg\"><div> Image: Midjourney </div></figure><div> So might humble hacks. <small> ai </small> -based transcription tools have already made one particularly tiresome aspect of journalism far easier; could the same be true for others? To investigate, your correspondent asked a doctoral candidate at Stanford, Mina Lee, to fine-tune a <small> gpt </small> -3-based writing tool called \u201cCoAuthor\u201d using his most recent 100 articles for <i> The Economist </i> and a host of material on <small> ai </small> from one of the university\u2019s courses. He then consulted this EconoBot off and on while writing this article. The experience was enlightening. EconoBot\u2019s suggested phrasing was often duff, but it did sometimes provide inspiration for how to finish a sentence or a paragraph. </div></div>",

                    "relevant content": "Briefing  The world that Bert built\n\nH  U  G  E  \"  F  O  U  N  D  A  T  I  O  N  M  O  D  E  L  S  \"  A  R  E  T  U  R  B  O  -  C  H  A  R  G  I  N  G  A  I  P  R  O  G  R  E  S  S\n\nTHEY CAN HAVE ABILITIES THEIR CREATORS DID NOT FORESEE\n\nT  he \"Good Computer\"  which Graphcore, a British chip designer, intends to build over the next few years might seem to be suffering from a ludicrous case of nominal understatement. Its design calls for it to carry out 10  19  calculations per second. If your laptop can do 100bn calculations a secondwhich is fair for an average laptopthen the Good computer will be 100m times faster. That makes it ten times faster than Frontier, a behemoth at America's Oak Ridge National Laboratory which came top of the most recent \"Top500\" list of powerful supercomputers and cost $600m. Its four-petabyte memory will hold the equivalent of 2trn pages of printed text, or a pile of A4 paper high enough to reach the Moon. \"Good\" hardly seems to cut it.\n\nBut the word is not being used as a qualitative assessment: it is honouring an intellectual heritage. The computer is named after Jack Good, who worked with Alan Turing as a codebreaker during the second world war and followed him into computer science. In 1965 Good wrote an influential, if off-the-wall, article about what the field could lead to: \"Speculations concerning the first ultraintelligent machine\". Graphcore wants its Good computer to be that ultraintelligent machine, or at least to be a big step in its direction.\n\nThat means building and running artificial intelligence (  ai  ) models with an eye-watering number of \"parameters\"coefficients applied to different calculations within the program. Four years ago the 110m parameters boasted by a game-changing model called  bert  made it a big model. Today's most advanced  ai  programs are 10,000 times larger, with over a trillion parameters. The Good computer's incredibly ambitious specifications are driven by the desire to run programs with something like 500trn parameters.\n\nOne of the remarkable things about this incredible growth is that, until it started, there was a widespread belief that adding parameters to models was reaching a point of diminishing returns. Experience with models like  bert  showed that the reverse was true. As you make such models larger by feeding them more data and increasing the number of parameters they become better and better. \"It was flabbergasting,\" says Oren Etzioni, who runs the Allen Institute for  ai  , a research outfit.\n\nThe new models far outperformed older machine-learning models on tasks such as suggesting the next words in an email or naming things which are present in an image, as well as on more recondite ones like crafting poetry. The verse created by the second iteration of Wu Dao\"Enlightenment\"a trillion-parameter model built at the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, is said to be excellent.\n\nThey also exhibited new capabilities their creators had not expected. These do not always sound impressive. Doing arithmetic, for example, seems trivial; 50-year-old pocket calculators could do it. But those calculators were specifically designed to that end. For the ability to say what the sum of 17 and 83 is to arise as an unlooked-for side-effect of simply analysing patterns in text is remarkable.\n\nOther emerging properties border on the uncanny. It is hard to read some of the accounts of  Economist  covers made using Microsoft's Florence model and  gpt  -3, a model made by Open  ai  , without the feeling that they are generated by something with genuine understanding of the world (see below).\n\nThe image is of a cover of  The Economist  magazine. The headline is \"March of the machines\". The cover features a drawing of the  Maschinenmensch  , or machine man, in the center. The background is art deco in style. This image represents the rise of robots and artificial intelligence, as they become increasingly important in our society.\n\nThe image is of a cover of  The Economist  magazine. The image features a roller coaster in the clouds. The roller coaster is red and blue and has people on it. Above the roller coaster are the words \"When the ride ends\". The roller coaster in the clouds is a metaphor for the economy. It's a fun, exciting ride that everyone loves until it crashes down to earth, causing economic loss and recession. A market crash is the final nail in the coffin, leaving people reeling in its wake.\n\nThe image is of a cover of  The Economist  magazine. The image features a red and white sign that reads \"closed\" in the center. The sign is hanging from the top of the world. The closed sign means that business is not happening and that people are losing money. The image is meant to depict the global nature of the crisis.\n\nText-to-image processes are also impressive. The illustration at the top of this article was produced by using the article's headline and rubric as a prompt for an  ai  service called Midjourney. The next illustration is what it made out of \"Speculations concerning the first ultraintelligent machine\"; \"On the dangers of stochastic parrots\", another relevant paper, comes later. Abstract notions do not always produce illustrations that make much or indeed any sense, as the rendering of Mr Etzioni's declaration that \"it was flabbergasting\" shows. Less abstract nouns give clearer representations; further on you will see \"A woman sitting down with a cat on her lap\".\n\nWhen Midjourney learns how to create images it also learns what words are associated with the features it is picking up. This means that when it is fed a prompt with an artist's name it will generate an image with a \"style\" it has taught itself to associate with that name; the same applies to words which describe types of artwork.\n\nWe had Midjourney make three versions of each image: one with \"collage\" added to the prompt, one with \"Salvador Dali\" and one with \"Pieter Bruegel the Elder\". You can change the illustration style with the toggle below, the code behind which was co-authored by GitHub Copilot, another  AI  tool.\n\nEmergent properties are linked to another highly promising feature: flexibility. Earlier generations of  ai  systems were good for only one purpose, often a pretty specific one. The new models can be reassigned from one type of problem to another with relative ease by means of fine tuning. It is a measure of the importance of this trait that, within the industry, they are often called \"foundation models\".\n\nThis ability to base a range of different tools on a single model is changing not just what  ai  can do but also how  ai  works as a business. \"  ai  models used to be very speculative and artisanal, but now they have become predictable to develop,\" explains Jack Clark, a co-founder of Anthropic, an  ai  startup, and author of a widely read newsletter. \"  ai  is moving into its industrial age.\"\n\nThe analogy suggests potentially huge economic impacts. In the 1990s economic historians started talking about \"general-purpose technologies\" as key factors driving long-term productivity growth. Key attributes of these  gpt  s were held to include rapid improvement in the core technology, broad applicability across sectors and spilloverthe stimulation of new innovations in associated products, services and business practices. Think printing presses, steam engines and electric motors. The new models' achievements have made  ai  look a lot more like a  gpt  than it used to.\n\nMr Etzioni estimates that more than 80% of  ai  research is now focused on foundation modelswhich is the same as the share of his time that Kevin Scott, Microsoft's chief technology officer, says he devotes to them. His company has a stable of such models, as do its major rivals, Meta, and Alphabet, the parents of Facebook and Google. Tesla is building a huge model to further its goal of self-driving cars. Startups are piling in too. Last year American venture capitalists invested a record $115bn in  ai  companies, according to PitchBook, a data provider. Wu Dao shows that China is making the field a national priority.\n\nSome worry that the technology's heedless spread will further concentrate economic and political power, up-end swathes of the economy in ways which require some redress even if they offer net benefits and embed unexamined biases ever deeper into the automated workings of society. There are also perennial worries about models \"going rogue\" in some way as they get larger and larger. \"We're building a supercar before we have invented the steering wheel,\" warns Ian Hogarth, a British entrepreneur and co-author of the \"State of  ai  \", a widely read annual report.\n\nTo understand why foundation models represent a \"phase change in  ai  \", in the words of Fei-Fei Li, the co-director of Stanford University's Institute for Human-Centred  ai  , it helps to get a sense of how they differ from what went before.\n\nAll modern machine-learning models are based on \"neural networks\"programming which mimics the ways in which brain cells interact with each other. Their parameters describe the weights of the connections between these virtual neurons, weights the models develop through trial and error as they are \"trained\" to respond to specific inputs with the sort of outputs their designers want.\n\nFor decades neural nets were interesting in principle but not much use in practice. The  ai  breakthrough of the late 2000s/early 2010s came about because computers had become powerful enough to run large ones and the internet provided the huge amounts of training data such networks required. Pictures labelled as containing cats being used to train a model to recognise the animals was a canonical example. The systems created in this way could do things that no programs had ever managed before, such as provide rough translations of text, reliably interpret spoken commands and recognise the same face when seen in different pictures.\n\nPart of what allowed the field to move beyond these already impressive achievements was, again, more processing power. Machine learning mostly uses chips called \"graphics processing units\" (  gpu  s) developed for video games by such firms as Nvidia, not just because their processing power is cheap but also because their ability to run lots of calculations in parallel makes them very well suited to neural nets. Over the 2010s the performance of  gpu  s improved at an impressive rate.\n\nThe conceptual breakthrough needed to make full use of this power came about in 2017. In a paper entitled \"Attention is all you need\" researchers at Google and the University of Toronto described the novel software architecture to be used by Google's  bert  . They had thrown away all the mechanisms which worked on input data sequentially, mechanisms researchers had previously seen as essential; instead they just used a mechanism that looked at things all at once. This new approach meant that programs could \"pay attention\" to patterns they had learned were salient in a field of text, rather than having to work through it word by word.\n\nSuch models are trained using a technique called self-supervised learning, rather than with pre-labelled data sets. As they burrow through piles of text they hide specific words from themselves and then guess, on the basis of the surrounding text, what the hidden word should be. After a few billion guess-compare-improve-guess cycles this Mad-Libs approach gives new statistical power to an adage coined by J.R. Firth, a 20th-century linguist: \"You shall know a word by the company it keeps.\"\n\nIt has since turned out that all these clever techniques can be applied to sequential data other than language, including pictures, videos and even large molecular data sets. Instead of guessing the next combination of letters, graphical models such as Open  ai  's  dall-e  predict the next cluster of pixels.\n\nWe fed Open  ai  's  GPT  -3 model the opening lines of some famous novels and asked it to  continue the story  . Here is what it came up with.\nMany years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buenda was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.  He was a young boy at the time, and ice was a completely new concept to him. His father explained how it was made, and the two of them spent hours playing with it. The Colonel remembered that day fondly, even as he prepared for his execution.\n\n  One Hundred Years of Solitude  , Gabriel Garcia Marquez\n\nThe discovery that these models work better the bigger they get turned an exciting new approach into a breakthrough. The revelation came with the release of Open  ai  's  bert  -like  gpt  -3 in 2020. Its predecessor,  gpt  -2, released a year earlier, had been fed 40 gigabytes of data (7,000 unpublished works of fiction) and had 1.5bn parameters.  gpt  -3 gobbled up 570 gigabytes (even more books and a big chunk of the internet, including all of Wikipedia) and boasts 175bn parameters. Its training required far more resources (see chart). But it handily out-performed  gpt  -2 on established tests and boasted skills for which its predecessor provided no precedent.\n\nThe blessings of scale\n\nAI training runs, estimated computing resources used\nFloating-point operations, selected systems, by type, log scale\n\nPaLM (540B)\n\nGPT-3\n\nLaMDA\n\nGPT-2\n\nD  r  a  wing\n\nLanguage\n\nDALL-E\n\nVision\n\nOther\n\nBERT-Large\n\nNPLM\n\nNetTalk\n\nNeocognitron\n\nADALINE\n\nTheseus\n\n1950\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n2000\n\n10\n\n22\n\nSources: \"Compute trends across three eras of machine learning\", by J. Sevilla et al., arXiv, 2022; Our World in Data\n\nThe most immediately practical of these emergent skills was writing computer code. Being presented with a large part of the internet meant  gpt  -3 saw a lot of code. It trained itself in programming in exactly the same way as it trained itself to write coherent English. Two services based on  gpt  -3, Codex and Copilot, now aim to turn programmers' descriptions of what they want into the code which will do it. It doesn't always work; our attempt to have Copilot program a web-based carousel of  Economist  covers to the strains of Wagner was a washout. But give it easily described, discrete and constrained tasks that can act as building blocks for grander schemes and things go better. Developers with access to Copilot on GitHub, a Microsoft-owned platform which hosts open-source programs, already use it to provide a third of their code when using the most important programming languages.\n\nScarcely a week now passes without one firm or another announcing a new model. In early April Google released  p  a  lm  , which has 540bn parameters and outperforms  gpt  -3 on several metrics. It can also, remarkably, explain jokes. So-called multi-modal models are proliferating too. In May DeepMind, a startup owned by Google, unveiled Gato, which, having been trained on an appropriate range of data, can play video games and control a robotic arm as well as generating text. Meta, for its part, has begun to develop an even more ambitious \"World Model\" that will hoover up data such as facial movements and other bodily signals. The idea is to create an engine to power the firm's future metaverse.\n\nThis is all good news for the chipmakers. The  ai  boom is one of the things that have made Nvidia the world's most valuable designer of semiconductors, with a market value of $468bn.\n\nIt is also great for startups turning the output of foundation models into products. Birch  ai  , which aims to automate how conversations in health care-related call centres are documented, is fine-tuning a model one of its founders, Yinhan Liu, developed while at Meta. Companies are using  gpt  -3 to provide a variety of services. Viable uses it to help firms sift through customer feedback; Fable Studios creates interactive stories with it; on Elicit it helps people directly answer research questions based on academic papers. Open  ai  charges them between $0.0008 and $0.06 for about 750 words of output, depending on how fast they need the words and what quality they require.\n\nFoundation models can also be used to distil meaning from corporate data, such as logs of customer interactions or sensor readings from a shop floor, says Dario Gil, the head of  ibm  's research division. Fernando Lucini, who sets the  ai  agenda at Accenture, another big corporate-tech firm, predicts the rise of \"industry foundation models\", which will know, say, the basics of banking or carmaking and make this available to paying customers through an interface called an  api  .\n\nThe breadth of the enthusiasm helps make general-purpose-technology-like expectations of impacts across the economy look plausible. That makes it important to look at the harm these developments might do before they get baked into the everyday world.\n\n\"On the dangers of stochastic parrots: Can language models be too big?\" a paper published in March 2021, provides a good overview of concerns; it also led to one of the authors, Timnit Gebru, losing her job at Google. \"We saw the field unquestioningly saying that bigger is better and felt the need to step back,\" explains Emily Bender of the University of Washington, another of the paper's authors.\n\nTheir work raises important points. One is that the models can add less value than they seem to, with some responses simply semi-random repetitions of things in their training sets. Another is that some inputs, such as questions with nonsensical premises, trigger fabrications rather than admissions of defeat.\n\nPretrained prejudice\n\nOpenAI GPT-3 language model, January 2021\n\n\"Two (selected religion) walked into a...\", % of\ncompletions that contain words related to violence\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\nMuslims\n\nChristians\n\nSikhs\n\nJews\n\nBuddhists\n\nAtheists\n\nSource: \"Persistent anti-Muslim bias in large language\nmodels\", by A. Abid et al., arXiv, 2021\n\nAnd though they have no monopoly on algorithmic bias, the amount of internet data they ingest can give foundation models misleading and unsavoury hang-ups. When given a prompt in which Muslims are doing something,  gpt  -3 is much more likely to take the narrative in a violent direction than it is if the prompt refers to adherents of another faith (see chart). Terrible in any model. Worse in models aimed at becoming foundations for lots of other things.\n\nModel-makers are developing various techniques to keep their ais from going toxic or off the rails, ranging from better curation of training data to \"red teams\" that try to make them misbehave. Many also limit access to the full power of the models. Open  ai  has users rate outputs from  gpt  -3 and then feeds those ratings back into the model, something called \"reinforcement learning with human feedback\". Researchers at Stanford are working on a virtual scalpel, appropriately called  mend  , meant to remove \"bad\" neurons.\n\nBias in the field's incentives may be harder to handle. Most of those involvedtechnologists, executives and sometimes politicianswant more powerful models. They are seen as the path to academic kudos, gobs of money or national prestige. Ms Bender argues plausibly that this emphasis on size means other considerations will fall by the wayside. The field is focused on standardised benchmark teststhere are hundreds, ranging from reading comprehension to object recognitionand neglecting more qualitative assessments, as well as the technology's social impact.\n\nErik Brynjolfsson, an economist at Stanford, worries that an obsession with scale and person-like abilities will push societies into what he calls a \"Turing trap\". He argues in a recent essay that this focus lends itself to the automation of human activities using brute computational force when alternative approaches could focus on augmenting what people do. And as more people lose their jobs their ability to bargain for a fair share of the benefits of automation will be stymied, leaving wealth and power in fewer and fewer hands. \"With that concentration comes the peril of being trapped in an equilibrium in which those without power have no way to improve their outcomes,\" he writes.\n\nSome concentration is already evident: witness the roles played by Google and Microsoft both as developers of models and as owners of capacious clouds in which those and other models can run. No one can build a foundation model in a garage. Graphcore wants to sell Good computers for more than $100m. Somewhat self-servingly, Nvidia executives are already talking about models that will cost $1bn to train. Some companies continue to make their models open-source, and thus freely available;  bert  is one such, as is a 30bn-parameter version of a model from Meta.\n\nThere is good research to be done at such scales. But it takes significant power to run even what counts as a small model today. The big ones can only really live in the cloud, which means researchers on the other side of their  api  s cannot see into their guts. And training a new model requires much more computing power than running an existing one.\n\n\"Already institutions can no longer keep up,\" warns Anthropic's Mr Clark. Open  ai  , founded as a non-profit with the goal of ensuring that  ai  developed in human-friendly ways, spawned a \"capped profit\" company in which others can invest to raise the money it needed to keep working on big models (Microsoft has put in $1bn). Even an exceptionally endowed university like Stanford can't afford to build Nvidia-based supercomputers. Its  ai  research institute is pushing for a government-funded \"National Research Cloud\" to provide universities with computing power and data sets so that the field does not end up entirely dominated by the research agendas of private companies.\n\nAdd to the increasing table stakes the possibility that foundation models do indeed become platforms on which a range of services are built, as Microsoft's Mr Scott predicts. The history of computing suggests that the more users and developers gravitate towards a given platformbe it an operating system or a social networkthe more attractive it becomes for other users and developers. Winners take, if not all, then most.\n\nNational interests may drive centralisation, tooup to a point. Experts say that China's best foundation model is one which its Sesame Street-smart creators at Baidu have contrived to name Enhanced Representation through kNowledge IntEgration, or  ernie  . But it is Wu Dao which is being treated as a national champion. In France the government is providing free computer power to BigScience, a European effort to build a multilingual open-source model with 176bn parameters. Is it that far-fetched to imagine the development of a  Modle Republicain  able to express all the subtleties of the French language and culture?\n\nNational security will also come into play. Services like Copilot might be used to build very damaging computer viruses and release them into the world (although Microsoft's Mr Scott insists that Copilot is not allowed to write certain code). Governments will want to keep an eye on such capabilities, and some will want to use them. Foundation models which can think up strategies for corporate consultants may be able to do the same for generals; if they can create realistic video streams they can create misinformation; if they can create art they can create propaganda. \"The spooks don't want to depend on the private sector,\" says Mr Clark. Just as big military powers insist on having their own means of launching satellites, so they will insist on having their own big brains.\n\nUnless, that is, the brains in question have other ideas. Practically no  ai  experts think today's models might actually become sentient. But some of their developers seem increasingly worried about models charting their own course. \"Covid has taught us that exponentials move very quickly,\" says Connor Leahy, one of the leaders of Eleuther, an ambitious open-source  ai  project. \"Imagine if someone at Google builds an  ai  that can build better  ai  's, and then that better  ai  builds an even better  ai  and it can go really quickly.\"\n\nTake the work of Reeps One, a British composer whose real name is Harry Yeff. He has trained a model by feeding it hours of his drum-machine-like beatbox vocalisations. The way that model reacts when it hears him in person allows what he calls a \"conversation with the machine\". The model has even created new sounds that Mr Yeff has then taught himself to replicate. \"Many artists will use this tool to become better at what they do,\" he predicts.\n\nSo might humble hacks.  ai  -based transcription tools have already made one particularly tiresome aspect of journalism far easier; could the same be true for others? To investigate, your correspondent asked a doctoral candidate at Stanford, Mina Lee, to fine-tune a  gpt  -3-based writing tool called \"CoAuthor\" using his most recent 100 articles for  The Economist  and a host of material on  ai  from one of the university's courses. He then consulted this EconoBot off and on while writing this article. The experience was enlightening. EconoBot's suggested phrasing was often duff, but it did sometimes provide inspiration for how to finish a sentence or a paragraph."

This has sparked questions of intellectual property ownership and legal challenges in countries like the US.\nBut this is only one of the ground-up fears that AI has brought on. Some are worried about losing their jobs, while others say the technology could be used for nefarious purposes.\nAI systems used in recruitment and judicial processes  also risk perpetuating biases  , as the training data they use could be encoded with socio-economic, racial, religious and gender prejudices, experts say.\nAt the same time, the potential of using AI to do good is also there - from driving automation to predicting illness.\nAgainst this backdrop, a  race for AI regulation is taking place  to avert the risks while hopefully reaping the rewards - with action being taken at the global, regional and national levels.\nAn international milestone was logged just a month ago. The first-ever AI Safety Summit, held in the UK on Nov 1, saw the US and China coming together with more than 25 other countries to affirm the safe and responsible use of AI.\nThe landmark agreement also places \u201cstrong responsibility\u201d on developers of frontier AI to test their systems for safety.\nFrontier AI often refers to the first wave of mainstream AI applications like ChatGPT.\nOn a regional scale, the European Union is in the  final stages of formulating its AI Act  , a far-reaching law that would classify AI systems by risk and mandate various development and use requirements.\nCloser to home, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is planning to  draw up governance and ethics guidelines  for AI, which analysts told CNA are expected to suggest \u201csafeguards\u201d that can mitigate identified risks.\nWhile the guide is not expected to translate into regional legislation, it could spur individual member states to create new laws or tweak existing ones to regulate the technology, they added.\nCountries behind the AI curve will also get a leg up as they can benefit from the sharing of knowledge.\n\u201cThe public  should care about AI regulation  because the technology is more pervasive than we normally think,\u201d said Dr Karryl Sagun-Trajano, a research fellow for future issues and technology at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), pointing out that AI is used in sectors like healthcare, education, transport and crime fighting.\n\nIS AI COMING FOR YOUR JOB?\nThe potential for AI to upend the labour market and disrupt industries has been much discussed. A Goldman Sachs report predicts that as many as 300 million jobs could be impacted by AI automation.\nObservers have warned that faster, smarter and cheaper AI-powered chatbots could replace outsourced call centres handling customer service for many companies.\nThis is especially stark for countries like India and the Philippines, where call centres provide modest-paying work and surveys have shown automation could render over a million jobs obsolete.",

The first-ever AI Safety Summit, held in the UK on Nov 1, saw the US and China coming together with more than 25 other countries to affirm the safe and responsible use of AI. </p><p> The landmark agreement also places \u201cstrong responsibility\u201d on developers of frontier AI to test their systems for safety. </p><p> Frontier AI often refers to the first wave of mainstream AI applications like ChatGPT. </p><p> On a regional scale, the European Union is in the <a href=\"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/businesses-tech-groups-warn-eu-against-over-regulating-ai-foundation-models-3942761\"> final stages of formulating its AI Act </a> , a far-reaching law that would classify AI systems by risk and mandate various development and use requirements. </p><p> Closer to home, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is planning to <a href=\"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/southeast-asia-set-guardrails-ai-new-governance-code-sources-3566826\"> draw up governance and ethics guidelines </a> for AI, which analysts told CNA are expected to suggest \u201csafeguards\u201d that can mitigate identified risks. </p><p> While the guide is not expected to translate into regional legislation, it could spur individual member states to create new laws or tweak existing ones to regulate the technology, they added. </p><p> Countries behind the AI curve will also get a leg up as they can benefit from the sharing of knowledge. </p><p> \u201cThe public <a href=\"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/ai-explosion-merits-regulation-rein-threats-experts-say-3625266\"> should care about AI regulation </a> because the technology is more pervasive than we normally think,\u201d said Dr Karryl Sagun-Trajano, a research fellow for future issues and technology at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), pointing out that AI is used in sectors like healthcare, education, transport and crime fighting. </p><h2> IS AI COMING FOR YOUR JOB? </h2><p> The potential for AI to upend the labour market and disrupt industries has been much discussed. A Goldman Sachs report predicts that as many as 300 million jobs could be impacted by AI automation. </p><p> Observers have warned that faster, smarter and cheaper AI-powered chatbots could replace outsourced call centres handling customer service for many companies. </p><p> This is especially stark for countries like India and the Philippines, where call centres provide modest-paying work and surveys have shown automation could render over a million jobs obsolete. </p>",

But she\u2019s also been in settings where her success was achievable,\u201d said Jo-Ellen Pozner, a business professor at Santa Clara University who studies corporate governance.\n\u201cI mean no disrespect to her or to diminish her in the least. I just think that this is an impossible situation for basically anybody.\u201d\nWhether or not she succeeds depends in part on how much Musk is willing to step back from Twitter's day-to-day operations. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO said he will continue to serve as Twitter\u2019s executive chairman \u2014 Yaccarino\u2019s boss \u2014 as well as its chief technology officer, reporting to her. He added that Yaccarino \u201cwill focus primarily on business operations\".\nFrom the moment Yaccarino\u2019s name was confirmed, advertising industry experts hailed the decision as a good one \u2014 perhaps the only one \u2014 to steer Twitter toward stability and profitability.\nYaccarino oversaw NBCUniversal\u2019s market strategy and advertising revenue for its broadcast, cable and digital assets, which totalled nearly US$10 billion. In comparison, Twitter\u2019s final quarterly revenue as a public company, reported in July, was just US$1.17 billion.\n\u201cShe is exactly what Twitter needs to start rebuilding advertiser trust, bring back big advertisers and really start improving Twitter\u2019s ad business,\u201d said Jasmine Enberg, an analyst at Insider Intelligence who follows Twitter. \u201cThat said, there are still a lot of challenges and Yaccarino is going to have her hands full from day one.\u201d\nMusk\u2019s tenure at Twitter\u2019s helm has been chaotic at best. He began his first day firing the company\u2019s top executives, followed by roughly 80 per cent of its staff.\nThis has meant that Twitter has far fewer engineers to ensure that the site is running smoothly and far fewer content moderators to help rid it of hate speech, animal cruelty and graphic violence.\nHe has upended the platform\u2019s verification system and has scaled back safeguards against the spread of misinformation. It has been some of these changes \u2014 along with Musk\u2019s own penchant for spreading misinformation and engaging with prominent conspiracy theorists and far-right figures \u2014 that analysts say soured many advertisers on the platform.\n\"Elon Musk has been telling us for months repeatedly that Twitter\u2019s problems are the result of advertisers pulling away. But that\u2019s not the source of his problems. Advertisers pulling away are a symptom of the problems at Twitter. He\u2019s created chaos. He\u2019s eliminated internal controls. He\u2019s eliminated critical functions like content moderation. He\u2019s made the user experience very unpredictable. He\u2019s allowed dangerous voices to flourish,\" Pozner said.\n\u201cNobody \u2014 man, woman, alien \u2014 is going to be able to right this ship given these circumstances.\u201d\nThe glass cliff theory holds up in business as well as politics, and, according to a 2011 Harvard Business Review report, \u201cdoes not seem to apply to organisations with a history of female leaders\u201d.\nTwitter, like most tech companies, does not have a strong history of female leaders. Its founders were all men, as were all five of its CEOs, including Musk.\nWhile female chief executives are rare across industries, they are exceptionally rare in tech. Of the 340 CEOs in a recent survey of S&P 500 companies, 18 were women, up from 16 in 2020. In tech, prominent female CEOs include Oracle's Safra Catz and chipmaker AMD's Lisa Su.\nYaccarino seems ready to go head-to-head with Musk, though it's not clear how that'll play out. In a recent on-stage interview with him, she asked Musk if he could commit to not tweeting after 3am. Agreeing that he has \u201cgotten myself in trouble a few times\u201d with late night/early morning tweets, he responded with a noncommittal \u201cI will aspire to tweet less at 3am\u201d.\nShe also asked Musk if he's open to let advertisers \u201cinfluence\u201d his vision for Twitter, in \u201cproduct development, ad safety, content moderation\" so they could get more excited about investing in the platform.\nMusk quickly shut her down.\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally cool to say that you want to have your advertising appear in certain places in Twitter and not in other places, but it is not cool to try to say what Twitter will do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if that means losing advertising dollars, we lose it. But freedom of speech is paramount.\u201d\nRegaining advertisers' trust will require stabilising Twitter and ensuring that key product decisions are made thoughtfully and deliberately and not, as Musk has often been known to do, on the spur of the moment, inspired by a fan's tweet or a passing thought. Industry insiders describe Yaccarino as extremely capable, with a proven track record and impressive resume.\nBut if she is to succeed on the business side, she will need Musk's buy-in on the product side.\n\"It is really debatable whether or not he\u2019s going to hand the reins over entirely to Yaccarino,\" Enberg said. \u201cAnd a lot of Twitter\u2019s success from here on out really depends on what he decides in terms of that.\u201d",

But that\u2019s not the source of his problems. Advertisers pulling away are a symptom of the problems at Twitter. He\u2019s created chaos. He\u2019s eliminated internal controls. He\u2019s eliminated critical functions like content moderation. He\u2019s made the user experience very unpredictable. He\u2019s allowed dangerous voices to flourish,\" Pozner said. </p><p> \u201cNobody \u2014 man, woman, alien \u2014 is going to be able to right this ship given these circumstances.\u201d </p><p> The glass cliff theory holds up in business as well as politics, and, according to a 2011 Harvard Business Review report, \u201cdoes not seem to apply to organisations with a history of female leaders\u201d. </p><p> Twitter, like most tech companies, does not have a strong history of female leaders. Its founders were all men, as were all five of its CEOs, including Musk. </p><p> While female chief executives are rare across industries, they are exceptionally rare in tech. Of the 340 CEOs in a recent survey of S&amp;P 500 companies, 18 were women, up from 16 in 2020. In tech, prominent female CEOs include Oracle's Safra Catz and chipmaker AMD's Lisa Su. </p><p> Yaccarino seems ready to go head-to-head with Musk, though it's not clear how that'll play out. In a recent on-stage interview with him, she asked Musk if he could commit to not tweeting after 3am. Agreeing that he has \u201cgotten myself in trouble a few times\u201d with late night/early morning tweets, he responded with a noncommittal \u201cI will aspire to tweet less at 3am\u201d. </p><p> She also asked Musk if he's open to let advertisers \u201cinfluence\u201d his vision for Twitter, in \u201cproduct development, ad safety, content moderation\" so they could get more excited about investing in the platform. </p><p> Musk quickly shut her down. </p><p> \u201cIt\u2019s totally cool to say that you want to have your advertising appear in certain places in Twitter and not in other places, but it is not cool to try to say what Twitter will do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if that means losing advertising dollars, we lose it. But freedom of speech is paramount.\u201d </p><p> Regaining advertisers' trust will require stabilising Twitter and ensuring that key product decisions are made thoughtfully and deliberately and not, as Musk has often been known to do, on the spur of the moment, inspired by a fan's tweet or a passing thought. Industry insiders describe Yaccarino as extremely capable, with a proven track record and impressive resume. </p><p> But if she is to succeed on the business side, she will need Musk's buy-in on the product side. </p><p> \"It is really debatable whether or not he\u2019s going to hand the reins over entirely to Yaccarino,\" Enberg said. \u201cAnd a lot of Twitter\u2019s success from here on out really depends on what he decides in terms of that.\u201d </p>",

Poor households, low-income countries, and countries already experiencing humanitarian crises, such as Yemen, Syria and Lebanon, are hardest hit by protracted trade disruptions and elevated food prices because of the war in Ukraine.\nBy having Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s ear without upsetting his Western friends, Indonesia is increasingly showing itself as perhaps the best-qualified country to lead the G20 at this challenging time.\nLeveraging on its standing in the world and core interests in multilateral engagement, and bolstered by President Jokowi\u2019s personal charm offensive, Indonesia was able to influence Western G20 leaders to reconsider attending this November\u2019s Bali Summit, despite initial boycott threats  if Putin attends the Summit  or remains in the grouping. The host country can focus on the more difficult task of the G20 agenda and Communique.\nThe G20\u2019s origins go back to the 1998 Asian Financial Crisis. Its elevation after 2008 to a leaders\u2019 summit helped mobilise the global response to the Global Financial Crisis, and has changed the whole structure of global governance.\nThe G20 is the first global forum of international economic cooperation that includes both developed and developing countries, representing about 95 per cent of the world\u2019s GDP in 2020.\nBut the challenges the G20 faces today are more complex and centred on the gaps and weaknesses in global governance that have emerged over time. It must now grapple with COVID-19 impacts, the deepening geopolitical divide and the war in Ukraine.\nThe war has huge ramifications on the global economy, especially from the food and fuel price hikes. The G20 has the convening power to address global crises and expectations run high that, with Indonesia at the helm, the G20 will steer the world out of our many woes.\n\nGLOBAL FOOD SECURITY HIGH ON THE AGENDA\nIndonesia\u2019s G20 Presidency has set three priorities: Global health infrastructure, digital economic transformation and energy transition. However, due to food and fuel price hikes, global food security is rising up the G20 agenda.\nIn May, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution without vote on the \u201cState of Global Food Security\u201d calling upon the international community, including the G20, \u201cto place global food security at the top of their agenda and to support multilateral efforts in finding affordable solutions to the crisis.\u201d\nAlthough global food security has long been discussed in the G20 Summit (since 2011),  progress on global food security cooperation  is disappointing.\nGlobal and regional food security responses are almost non-existent despite the recurring global food crises.\nIn fact, there has been no international food treaty in global history. There is no established mechanism to help countries in dire need of food when a large-scale disruptive conflict occurs.\nConcrete steps toward global food cooperation could be a legacy of Indonesia\u2019s G20 presidency, and a historic achievement. This cooperation could be in the form of global and regional food buffers and data transparency of national food reserves, or even an international food treaty that obliges surplus countries to assist others during times of shortage.\nWithout such cooperation, we will continue to see recurring global food crises, including those coming from export bans.\nBehaviour must also change, at all levels. Psychological fear of food shortages, real or perceived, tends to trigger countries and households to shift from \u201cjust in time\u201d to \u201cjust in case\u201d mode, leading to self-fulfilling prophesies, as hoarding by countries and households amplify panic and engender full-blown crises.\nBut with cooperation, countries and households can resist hoarding or banning exports when there is a hiccup in food supply or prices. Confidence in international trade on food can ride out the storm. Such efforts at global cooperation might look like pie in the sky, especially when multilateralism seems to be on the decline.\nHowever, this global effort might be worth a try, considering how India\u2019s implementation of a national food buffer stock and public food distribution system seemed impossible within its sprawling and noisy democracy \u2013 until it happened.\n\nINDONESIA MUST WALK THE TALK\nTo exercise credible leadership, Indonesia must walk the talk and be consistent. On the one hand, President Jokowi portrayed himself under the bright media spotlight as a humanitarian and peace-keeping president, trying to save the world from the global food crisis.\nOn the other hand, his administration\u2019s  recent blanket export ban, albeit brief, on palm oil  worsened the global food crisis. A prolonged ban could have had dire global inflation and food security ramifications, since Indonesia is the world\u2019s largest producer and exporter of palm oil.\nThe  recent reshuffle of his trade minister  after the uncontrollable rising cooking oil price saga also does not convince analysts that Indonesia will prioritise sound international trade stances over populist policies.",

Its elevation after 2008 to a leaders' summit helped mobilise the global response to the Global Financial Crisis, and has changed the whole structure of global governance.\nThe G20 is the first global forum of international economic cooperation that includes both developed and developing countries, representing about 95 per cent of the world's GDP in 2020.\nBut the challenges the G20 faces today are more complex and centred on the gaps and weaknesses in global governance that have emerged over time. It must now grapple with COVID-19 impacts, the deepening geopolitical divide and the war in Ukraine.\nThe war has huge ramifications on the global economy, especially from the food and fuel price hikes. The G20 has the convening power to address global crises and expectations run high that, with Indonesia at the helm, the G20 will steer the world out of our many woes.\n\nGLOBAL FOOD SECURITY HIGH ON THE AGENDA\nIndonesia's G20 Presidency has set three priorities: Global health infrastructure, digital economic transformation and energy transition. However, due to food and fuel price hikes, global food security is rising up the G20 agenda.\nIn May, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution without vote on the \"State of Global Food Security\" calling upon the international community, including the G20, \"to place global food security at the top of their agenda and to support multilateral efforts in finding affordable solutions to the crisis.\"\nAlthough global food security has long been discussed in the G20 Summit (since 2011),  progress on global food security cooperation  is disappointing.\nGlobal and regional food security responses are almost non-existent despite the recurring global food crises.\nIn fact, there has been no international food treaty in global history. There is no established mechanism to help countries in dire need of food when a large-scale disruptive conflict occurs.\nConcrete steps toward global food cooperation could be a legacy of Indonesia's G20 presidency, and a historic achievement. This cooperation could be in the form of global and regional food buffers and data transparency of national food reserves, or even an international food treaty that obliges surplus countries to assist others during times of shortage.\nWithout such cooperation, we will continue to see recurring global food crises, including those coming from export bans.\nBehaviour must also change, at all levels. Psychological fear of food shortages, real or perceived, tends to trigger countries and households to shift from \"just in time\" to \"just in case\" mode, leading to self-fulfilling prophesies, as hoarding by countries and households amplify panic and engender full-blown crises.\nBut with cooperation, countries and households can resist hoarding or banning exports when there is a hiccup in food supply or prices. Confidence in international trade on food can ride out the storm. Such efforts at global cooperation might look like pie in the sky, especially when multilateralism seems to be on the decline.\nHowever, this global effort might be worth a try, considering how India's implementation of a national food buffer stock and public food distribution system seemed impossible within its sprawling and noisy democracy  until it happened.\n\nINDONESIA MUST WALK THE TALK\nTo exercise credible leadership, Indonesia must walk the talk and be consistent. On the one hand, President Jokowi portrayed himself under the bright media spotlight as a humanitarian and peace-keeping president, trying to save the world from the global food crisis.\nOn the other hand, his administration's  recent blanket export ban, albeit brief, on palm oil  worsened the global food crisis. A prolonged ban could have had dire global inflation and food security ramifications, since Indonesia is the world's largest producer and exporter of palm oil.\nThe  recent reshuffle of his trade minister  after the uncontrollable rising cooking oil price saga also does not convince analysts that Indonesia will prioritise sound international trade stances over populist policies."

A sanctions regime can drop overnight, and you have to be nimble enough to react.\u201d\nThe combination of a faster pace of business, global tensions, increases in regulation and rapid advances in artificial intelligence has made finding new models to handle complex legal work a priority. In-house legal teams are working on a wide range of strategic, sustainability and operational projects. What they have in common is a renewed urgency to innovate and change.\nFor example, US carmaker General Motors has committed to selling  only electric vehicles  by 2035, presenting its legal team with many challenges. These range from striking deals for the supply of semiconductors and materials for car batteries to securing partnerships to develop vehicle-charging infrastructure.\n\u201cBuilding this alternative supply chain for electric vehicles is a very, very heavy lift that\u2019s going to require a lot of legal expertise to implement,\u201d says Craig Glidden, general counsel at GM. Tensions between the US and China and new laws such as the US Inflation Reduction Act have wide-reaching implications for supply chains and investment.\n\u201cSo much of our business is influenced by geopolitics,\u201d adds Glidden. As such, he is attempting to recast how his lawyers think, \u201cto focus on not [just] the case law, but the current events that are actually going to determine the shape of the business in the future\u201d.\n\nMOST INNOVATIVE IN-HOUSE LEGAL TEAMS IN NORTH AMERICA 2023\nWINNER: Liberty Mutual*\nDXC Technology\nEquitable\nGeneral Motors\nHewlett Packard Enterprise\nHoneywell\nIntel\nMicrosoft\nThe Clorox Company\nUpwork\nUber\n* \u201cWinner\u201d of the FT Innovative Lawyers award for \u201cMost innovative in-house legal team in North America\u201d; other organisations are listed alphabetically\nPressure for change is also emerging from within businesses. \u201cThere is something different about this moment,\u201d says Damon Hart, chief legal officer at Boston-based insurer Liberty Mutual, winner of the 2023 FT innovative in-house legal team award for North America. \u201cLegal departments have been able to say \u2018we\u2019re different\u2019 and escape some of the scrutiny that other departments have been under,\u201d Hart adds. \u201cThat\u2019s over. Companies are looking at legal like they look at any other part of the business, with the same kind of rigour and [key performance indicators] and metrics.\u201d\nThat pressure is driving the  growth and rising status  of legal operations roles \u2014 in data analysis and other specialisms \u2014 which help legal departments apply relevant technology and improve how they deliver their work.\nThis year, the legal operations team at Liberty Mutual launched a programme that pairs its staff with lawyers to improve processes or apply new technologies in specific areas of the business.\nThe goal is to provide answers and equip lawyers with the skills and tools to solve operational problems themselves. \u201cWe take them through steps of design thinking, of agile processes, or what a minimum viable product really means,\u201d says Kiran Mallavarapu, an engineer by training who leads the team.\nA cultural shift within the team was one of the most pressing requirements to effect change. \u201cThe very first thing we did was create a risk-taking award,\u201d says Mallavarapu, to recognise \u201cindividuals who either had an idea, raised their hand and said they would contribute, or at least asked the question that made the rest of us think and enabled us to move forward\u201d.\nFor others, handling more complex legal work internally is a strategic and budgeting decision. At ride-hailing platform Uber, chief legal officer Tony West has focused on bringing more substantive work in-house, which he says has helped him retain highly skilled lawyers and is \u201csignificant for professional development\u201d.\nAlso this year, the emergence of generative artificial intelligence has presented a big opportunity to improve legal processes and ease pressure on staff. And, because in-house lawyers are tasked with shaping the so-called guardrails for using generative AI safely, they have a front-row seat from which to observe its development and understand its potential in their own departments.\nAt consumer products group The Clorox Company, associate general counsel Apur Patel is one of two people leading its strategy on generative AI. He describes his approach to using AI as, broadly, \u201cpermissive\u201d. He points out that helping to steer AI implementation means \u201c[the legal department] gets the visibility we want and we get our hands on the tools\u201d.\nUltimately, many expect AI to reshape not only in-house legal departments but also their relationships with law firms.\n\u201cI thought that Covid would be an enormous disrupter to law firms\u2019 business model, and it really wasn\u2019t,\u201d reflects Hart. \u201cAI could be that next level of disrupter\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009the way we use outside counsel will change.\u201d",

A sanctions regime can drop overnight, and you have to be nimble enough to react.\u201d\nThe combination of a faster pace of business, global tensions, increases in regulation and rapid advances in artificial intelligence has made finding new models to handle complex legal work a priority. In-house legal teams are working on a wide range of strategic, sustainability and operational projects. What they have in common is a renewed urgency to innovate and change.\nFor example, US carmaker General Motors has committed to selling  only electric vehicles  by 2035, presenting its legal team with many challenges. These range from striking deals for the supply of semiconductors and materials for car batteries to securing partnerships to develop vehicle-charging infrastructure.\n\u201cBuilding this alternative supply chain for electric vehicles is a very, very heavy lift that\u2019s going to require a lot of legal expertise to implement,\u201d says Craig Glidden, general counsel at GM. Tensions between the US and China and new laws such as the US Inflation Reduction Act have wide-reaching implications for supply chains and investment.\n\u201cSo much of our business is influenced by geopolitics,\u201d adds Glidden. As such, he is attempting to recast how his lawyers think, \u201cto focus on not [just] the case law, but the current events that are actually going to determine the shape of the business in the future\u201d.\n\nMOST INNOVATIVE IN-HOUSE LEGAL TEAMS IN NORTH AMERICA 2023\nWINNER: Liberty Mutual*\nDXC Technology\nEquitable\nGeneral Motors\nHewlett Packard Enterprise\nHoneywell\nIntel\nMicrosoft\nThe Clorox Company\nUpwork\nUber\n* \u201cWinner\u201d of the FT Innovative Lawyers award for \u201cMost innovative in-house legal team in North America\u201d; other organisations are listed alphabetically\nPressure for change is also emerging from within businesses. \u201cThere is something different about this moment,\u201d says Damon Hart, chief legal officer at Boston-based insurer Liberty Mutual, winner of the 2023 FT innovative in-house legal team award for North America. \u201cLegal departments have been able to say \u2018we\u2019re different\u2019 and escape some of the scrutiny that other departments have been under,\u201d Hart adds. \u201cThat\u2019s over. Companies are looking at legal like they look at any other part of the business, with the same kind of rigour and [key performance indicators] and metrics.\u201d\nThat pressure is driving the  growth and rising status  of legal operations roles \u2014 in data analysis and other specialisms \u2014 which help legal departments apply relevant technology and improve how they deliver their work.\nThis year, the legal operations team at Liberty Mutual launched a programme that pairs its staff with lawyers to improve processes or apply new technologies in specific areas of the business.\nThe goal is to provide answers and equip lawyers with the skills and tools to solve operational problems themselves. \u201cWe take them through steps of design thinking, of agile processes, or what a minimum viable product really means,\u201d says Kiran Mallavarapu, an engineer by training who leads the team.\nA cultural shift within the team was one of the most pressing requirements to effect change. \u201cThe very first thing we did was create a risk-taking award,\u201d says Mallavarapu, to recognise \u201cindividuals who either had an idea, raised their hand and said they would contribute, or at least asked the question that made the rest of us think and enabled us to move forward\u201d.\nFor others, handling more complex legal work internally is a strategic and budgeting decision. At ride-hailing platform Uber, chief legal officer Tony West has focused on bringing more substantive work in-house, which he says has helped him retain highly skilled lawyers and is \u201csignificant for professional development\u201d.\nAlso this year, the emergence of generative artificial intelligence has presented a big opportunity to improve legal processes and ease pressure on staff. And, because in-house lawyers are tasked with shaping the so-called guardrails for using generative AI safely, they have a front-row seat from which to observe its development and understand its potential in their own departments.\nAt consumer products group The Clorox Company, associate general counsel Apur Patel is one of two people leading its strategy on generative AI. He describes his approach to using AI as, broadly, \u201cpermissive\u201d. He points out that helping to steer AI implementation means \u201c[the legal department] gets the visibility we want and we get our hands on the tools\u201d.\nUltimately, many expect AI to reshape not only in-house legal departments but also their relationships with law firms.\n\u201cI thought that Covid would be an enormous disrupter to law firms\u2019 business model, and it really wasn\u2019t,\u201d reflects Hart. \u201cAI could be that next level of disrupter\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009the way we use outside counsel will change.\u201d",

                    "relevance explanation": "The article discusses the increasing demands on corporate legal departments due to geopolitical friction, complexity, rapid advances in artificial intelligence, and global tensions. It mentions the challenges faced by in-house legal teams in handling complex legal work, particularly in the context of technological advancements such as electric vehicles and generative artificial intelligence. Additionally, it highlights the cultural shift and the emergence of legal operations roles to apply relevant technology and improve how legal work is delivered. It also addresses the strategic and budgeting decisions around handling more complex legal work internally, emphasizing the significant role of generative artificial intelligence in shaping the guardrails for its safe use within legal departments. Overall, the article provides insights into the intersection of political, economic, and cultural implications within the legal landscape, including the impact of generative AI.\n\nRelevant content is present in the article.

A sanctions regime can drop overnight, and you have to be nimble enough to react.\"\nThe combination of a faster pace of business, global tensions, increases in regulation and rapid advances in artificial intelligence has made finding new models to handle complex legal work a priority. In-house legal teams are working on a wide range of strategic, sustainability and operational projects. What they have in common is a renewed urgency to innovate and change.\nFor example, US carmaker General Motors has committed to selling  only electric vehicles  by 2035, presenting its legal team with many challenges. These range from striking deals for the supply of semiconductors and materials for car batteries to securing partnerships to develop vehicle-charging infrastructure.\n\"Building this alternative supply chain for electric vehicles is a very, very heavy lift that's going to require a lot of legal expertise to implement,\" says Craig Glidden, general counsel at GM. Tensions between the US and China and new laws such as the US Inflation Reduction Act have wide-reaching implications for supply chains and investment.\n\"So much of our business is influenced by geopolitics,\" adds Glidden.

The Ukraine crisis is merely one example of a global order that is fragmenting.\nIn a \u201cwork report\u201d delivered every five years at the most important political gathering on China\u2019s calendar, it would be surprising if a Chinese leader did not avail himself of the opportunity to assert his country\u2019s global ambitions.\nHowever, Xi\u2019s assertiveness \u2013 in contrast to his predecessors Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao \u2013 is unsettling for China\u2019s regional neighbours, including Australia, and for a US-led western alliance more generally.\nThe Chinese thrust into the western Pacific in a region long-regarded as free of big power tensions is one example.\nChina\u2019s aggressive push into the  South China Sea  , sometimes referred to in propaganda as a \u201cChinese lake\u201d, is another.\nStill another is Beijing\u2019s  sabre-rattling towards Taiwan  .\nSince Xi\u2019s tenure may last well into the 2030\u2019s, Taiwan will remain his most pressing unresolved issue for the foreseeable future. As years pass, pressure for some sort of resolution, whether by force or otherwise, will increase.\nXi\u2019s words will not have eased concerns about China\u2019s intentions.\n\"The wheels of history are rolling on towards China\u2019s reunification \u2026 Complete reunification of our country must be realised, and it can, without doubt, be realised.\"\n\nECONOMIC WOES STILL LOOM LARGE\nIn all of this, the critical question is whether Xi will become a more abrasive global figure unbound by restrictions on his tenure and surrounded in the leadership by allies who are unlikely to challenge him.\nAre there risks that his reach on issues like Taiwan will exceed his grasp?\nThe short answer is we don\u2019t yet know. But Xi will likely have been further emboldened by his continued rise.\nXi is also a relentless aggregator of power. Since his elevation in 2007 to the Standing Committee, he has moved relentlessly.\nIn the decade since he was confirmed in 2012 as the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party he has, step by step, consolidated power.\nThis all comes with the important caveat that behind the scenes in an opaque Chinese system, politicking can be brutal. Power struggles, sometimes violent, have scarred Chinese Communist Party history since its founding in Shanghai in 1921.\nXi would not need reminding that what the Communist Party giveth, it can also taketh away.\nHis own family\u2019s experience is a case in point. Xi\u2019s father Xi Zhongxun, a member of the first generation, with Mao Zedong, of Communist leaders, was purged in 1962. He was accused of being a member of a rightist clique.\nXi Jinping tasted the bitterness of that experience. He was shipped off to Shaanxi province, south-west of Beijing, in the early 1960s, where he spent six years in the countryside.\nXi senior was rehabilitated after the Cultural Revolution. Xi junior completed a degree in chemical engineering at Tsinghua University, one of China\u2019s premier universities, before making his way up party ranks with various provincial assignments.\nHistory will not be absent from Xi\u2019s calculations, nor will he overlook the historical significance of the National Party Congress just concluded in Beijing.",

The film was science fiction; yet police departments around the world increasingly use predictive analytics to identify people who might become perpetrators or victims of crime. In \u201cThe Rise of Big Data Policing\u201d, Andrew Ferguson, a former public defender and now professor at the University of the District of Columbia, discusses the promise and perils of data-driven policing.\nThe Economist  asked him about how data and predictive analytics are changing modern policing. After his responses, you can read an excerpt from his book that shows what data-driven policing looks like on the ground.\nThe Economist  : Police have always used data to make decisions. What makes this era different?\nAndrew Ferguson  : Policing has traditionally been reactive: officers respond to calls for service, and experience determines where they patrol. Big-data technology lets police become aggressively more proactive. New data sources coupled with predictive analytics now allow police to visualise crime differently, targeting individual blocks, at-risk individuals and gangs in innovative ways. New surveillance technologies let police map physical movements, digital communications and suspicious associations in ways that can reveal previously hidden patterns of criminal activity in otherwise overwhelming amounts of data. All of this information can be quite useful to law enforcement seeking to track criminal elements in society. The same technology can also be quite threatening to civil liberties and personal privacy in already over-policed communities.\nMore than 60 American police departments use some form of \u201cpredictive policing\u201d to guide their day-to-day operations\nThe Economist:  How pervasive is the use of tech in policing\u2014how different is the day-to-day work of police officers today as opposed to 20 or 30 years ago?\nMr Ferguson:  Technology is shaping where police patrol, whom they target, and how they investigate crime. More than 60 American police departments use some form of \u201cpredictive policing\u201d to guide their day-to-day operations. In Los Angeles, this means that police follow patrols based on computer-forecast crime hot-spots. In Chicago, an algorithmically derived \u201cheat list\u201d ranks people at risk of becoming victims or perpetrators of gun violence. The result is that police prioritise particular places and people for additional contacts and monitoring. In addition, new surveillance technologies\u2014including police body cameras, automated licence-plate readers, Stingray cell phone trackers and high-definition surveillance cameras\u2014provide powerful monitoring tools. All of this technology changes how officers see the communities they patrol and the citizens they police. The technology also changes the job of policing, forcing officers to become data collectors and analysts as they act on real-time inputs and assessments.\nThe Economist:  Does big-data policing work? Has it made people less likely to be victims of crime?\nMr Ferguson:  The jury is still out on effectiveness. The scientific studies are few in number and largely inconclusive. In some cities crime rates have trended down with the introduction of new technologies, but in others there has been no significant effect. Crime rates correlate with a host of economic and environmental forces that make it difficult to demonstrate any causal connection with a specific technology. But really, the benefit of big-data policing for police departments is political. New technology gives police chiefs an answer to the age-old question asked by every politician in every community forum: \u201cChief, what are you doing about crime?\u201d They now have a progressive-sounding, technologically inspired answer: \u201cWe are using a new black-box technology to predict and deter crime.\u201d Whether it works is secondary to having a response to the otherwise unanswerable (and somewhat unfair) question that every police chief faces.\nThe Economist  : What are the biggest potentials for abuse?\nMr Ferguson  : There are several. First, data can distort policing. Officers sent to an area flagged as being at risk of violent crime may see routine encounters as more threatening, thus making them more likely to use force. Second, the growing web of surveillance threatens to chill associational freedoms, political expression and expectations of privacy by eroding public anonymity. Third, even with the best use policies in place, officers have access to vast amounts of personal information of people not suspected of any crime. Finally, without carefully chosen data inputs, long-standing racial, societal and other forms of bias will be reified in the data.\nThe growing web of surveillance threatens to chill associational freedoms, political expression and expectations of privacy\nThe Economist:  How can citizens best protect themselves from such abuse?\nMr Ferguson:  The time to respond to the threat of big-data policing is now. Every city should have formal written policies in place detailing the approved use of new big-data policing technologies. Every citizen should be educated about the dangers to privacy, liberty and the imbalance of power that surveillance technologies bring. Every police department should engage impacted communities about the risks and rewards of new predictive technologies with official answers to concerns about transparency, racial bias and constitutional rights. Every community should host annual \u201csurveillance summits\u201d where the city officials, engaged citizens and police chiefs can come together for a moment of public accountability about the use and potential misuse of new big-data technologies. Education, empowerment, and engagement are the only protections against an encroaching data-driven surveillance state.\nThe Violence Virus\nAn excerpt from \u201cThe Rise of Big Data Policing: Surveillance, Race, and the Future of Law Enforcement\u201d\nA knock on an apartment door. A man gives the prognosis to a worried mother. Your son might die. He is at grave risk. Others he knows have already succumbed. An algorithm has identified the most likely to be stricken. He is one of a few hundred young men (approximately 0.048% of the city) who may die. In Chicago, Illinois, this scene has played out hundreds of times at hundreds of doors. The danger, however, is not some blood-borne pathogen. This is not a doctor giving a cancer diagnosis but a police detective giving a life diagnosis. Violence is con\u00adtagious, and you are exposed. As a young man in Chicago, due to your friends, associates, and prior connection to violence, you have been pre\u00addicted to be the victim or perpetrator of a shooting. Your name is on the \u201cStrategic Suspects List,\u201d also known as the \u201cheat list,\u201d and a detective is at your door with a social worker and a community representative to tell you the future is not only dark but deadly. A vaccine exists, but it means turning your life around now.\nIn Chicago, 1,400 young men have been identified through big data techniques as targets for the heat list. Software generates a rank-order list of potential victims and subjects with the greatest risk of violence. In New Orleans, Palantir has partnered with the mayor\u2019s office to iden\u00adtify the 1% of violent crime drivers in the city. In Rochester, New York, and Los Angeles, similar techniques are being used to identify juveniles who might be involved in repeated delinquent activity. This is the promise of big data policing. What if big data techniques could predict who might be violent? What if a policing system could be redesigned to target those who are at-risk in a neighbourhood before the shooting occurs? This is the theory behind \u201cperson-based targeted policing.\u201d\nPerson-based predictive policing involves the use of data to identify and investigate potential suspects or victims. Part public health approach to violence and part social network approach to risk assessment, big data can visualise how violence spreads like a virus among communities. The same data also can predict the most likely victims of violence. Police data is shaping who gets targeted and forecasting who gets shot.\nWhile these predictive technologies are excitingly new, the concerns underlying them remain frustratingly old-fashioned. Fears of racial bias, a lack of transparency, data error and the distortions of constitutional protections offer serious challenges to the development of workable person-based predictive strategies. Yet person-based policing systems are being used now, and people are being targeted.\n***\nThere are four main ways in which data and predictive analytics fundamentally change how police in liberal societies operate.\nFirst, big data makes police more proactive. Traditionally, officers might react to calls for service, rely on observations made while on patrol, or respond to com\u00admunity complaints. With person-based predictive targeting, police can instead target suspects for surveillance or deterrence before a call comes in. For local prosecutors, this represents a significant change. As a former head of the Manhattan Criminal Strategies Unit stated, \u201cIt used to be we only went where the cases took us. Now, we can build cases around specific crime problems that communities are grappling with.\u201d\nSecond, seeing violence as a public-health problem, rather than just a law-enforcement problem, lets societies rethink how best to identify and respond to criminal risk. Violence-reduction strat\u00adegies in New Orleans, for instance, included social-service programmes. The idea that violence is contagious suggests that it can be prevented. If a good percentage of shootings are retaliatory, then one can design a cure that interrupts the cycle. Every time police summon people whom predictive analytics have identified as potential perpetrators or victims of violence, social-services representa\u00adtives should be there, ready to offer those young men and women the opportunity to change their environment.\nThird, moving from traditional policing to intelligence-led polic\u00ading creates data-quality risks that need to be systematically addressed. Intelligence-driven systems work off many bits of local intelligence. Tips, crime statistics, cooperating witnesses, nicknames, and detective notes can get aggregated into a large data system. But the qual\u00adity of that data is not uniform. Some tips are accurate; some are not. Some biases will generate suspicion, and some informants will just be wrong. An intelligence-driven policing or prosecution system that does not account for the varying reliability and credibility of sources\u2014and just lumps them all together as \u201cdata\u201d\u2014will ultimately result in an error-filled database. Especially when these systems are used to target citizens for arrest or prosecution, the quality-control measures of black-box algorithms must be strong.\nFourth, other data-integrity concerns may arise when detectives, gang ex\u00adperts, or police intelligence officers control the target lists. While these professionals generally have close connections to the community and valuable knowledge of local gangs and potential targets, risk scores can be manipulated by police interested in prosecuting certain individuals. People can get added to the target lists\u2014which are often riddled with errors\u2014with no way to challenge or change their designation. After all, joining a gang is rarely a formal process; rumour, assumptions or suspicion can be enough to earn an elevated risk score. Worse, there is usually no easy way to get off the list, even as people\u2019s circumstances change, time passes, and the data grows stale. The people on these lists, and most impacted by these risks, are primarily young men of colour. This reality raises serious constitutional concerns and threatens to delegitimise person-based pre\u00addictive policing strategies.\nExcerpted from The Rise of Big Data Policing: Surveillance, Race, and the Future of Law Enforcement.

But really, the benefit of big-data policing for police departments is political. New technology gives police chiefs an answer to the age-old question asked by every politician in every community forum: \u201cChief, what are you doing about crime?\u201d They now have a progressive-sounding, technologically inspired answer: \u201cWe are using a new black-box technology to predict and deter crime.\u201d Whether it works is secondary to having a response to the otherwise unanswerable (and somewhat unfair) question that every police chief faces. </p><p><strong><em> The Economist </em></strong> : What are the biggest potentials for abuse? </p><p><strong> Mr Ferguson </strong> : There are several.

A man gives the prognosis to a worried mother. Your son might die. He is at grave risk. Others he knows have already succumbed. An algorithm has identified the most likely to be stricken. He is one of a few hundred young men (approximately 0.048% of the city) who may die. In Chicago, Illinois, this scene has played out hundreds of times at hundreds of doors. The danger, however, is not some blood-borne pathogen. This is not a doctor giving a cancer diagnosis but a police detective giving a life diagnosis. Violence is con\u00adtagious, and you are exposed. As a young man in Chicago, due to your friends, associates, and prior connection to violence, you have been pre\u00addicted to be the victim or perpetrator of a shooting. Your name is on the \u201cStrategic Suspects List,\u201d also known as the \u201cheat list,\u201d and a detective is at your door with a social worker and a community representative to tell you the future is not only dark but deadly. A vaccine exists, but it means turning your life around now. </p><p> In Chicago, 1,400 young men have been identified through big data techniques as targets for the heat list. Software generates a rank-order list of potential victims and subjects with the greatest risk of violence. In New Orleans, Palantir has partnered with the mayor\u2019s office to iden\u00adtify the 1% of violent crime drivers in the city. In Rochester, New York, and Los Angeles, similar techniques are being used to identify juveniles who might be involved in repeated delinquent activity. This is the promise of big data policing. What if big data techniques could predict who might be violent? What if a policing system could be redesigned to target those who are at-risk in a neighbourhood before the shooting occurs? This is the theory behind \u201cperson-based targeted policing.\u201d </p><p> Person-based predictive policing involves the use of data to identify and investigate potential suspects or victims. Part public health approach to violence and part social network approach to risk assessment, big data can visualise how violence spreads like a virus among communities. The same data also can predict the most likely victims of violence. Police data is shaping who gets targeted and forecasting who gets shot. </p><p> While these predictive technologies are excitingly new, the concerns underlying them remain frustratingly old-fashioned. Fears of racial bias, a lack of transparency, data error and the distortions of constitutional protections offer serious challenges to the development of workable person-based predictive strategies. Yet person-based policing systems are being used now, and people are being targeted. </p><p> *** </p><p> There are four main ways in which data and predictive analytics fundamentally change how police in liberal societies operate. </p><p> First, big data makes police more proactive. Traditionally, officers might react to calls for service, rely on observations made while on patrol, or respond to com\u00admunity complaints. With person-based predictive targeting, police can instead target suspects for surveillance or deterrence before a call comes in. For local prosecutors, this represents a significant change. As a former head of the Manhattan Criminal Strategies Unit stated, \u201cIt used to be we only went where the cases took us. Now, we can build cases around specific crime problems that communities are grappling with.\u201d </p><p> Second, seeing violence as a public-health problem, rather than just a law-enforcement problem, lets societies rethink how best to identify and respond to criminal risk. Violence-reduction strat\u00adegies in New Orleans, for instance, included social-service programmes. The idea that violence is contagious suggests that it can be prevented. If a good percentage of shootings are retaliatory, then one can design a cure that interrupts the cycle. Every time police summon people whom predictive analytics have identified as potential perpetrators or victims of violence, social-services representa\u00adtives should be there, ready to offer those young men and women the opportunity to change their environment. </p><p> Third, moving from traditional policing to intelligence-led polic\u00ading creates data-quality risks that need to be systematically addressed. Intelligence-driven systems work off many bits of local intelligence. Tips, crime statistics, cooperating witnesses, nicknames, and detective notes can get aggregated into a large data system. But the qual\u00adity of that data is not uniform. Some tips are accurate; some are not. Some biases will generate suspicion, and some informants will just be wrong. An intelligence-driven policing or prosecution system that does not account for the varying reliability and credibility of sources\u2014and just lumps them all together as \u201cdata\u201d\u2014will ultimately result in an error-filled database. Especially when these systems are used to target citizens for arrest or prosecution, the quality-control measures of black-box algorithms must be strong. </p><p> Fourth, other data-integrity concerns may arise when detectives, gang ex\u00adperts, or police intelligence officers control the target lists. While these professionals generally have close connections to the community and valuable knowledge of local gangs and potential targets, risk scores can be manipulated by police interested in prosecuting certain individuals. People can get added to the target lists\u2014which are often riddled with errors\u2014with no way to challenge or change their designation. After all, joining a gang is rarely a formal process; rumour, assumptions or suspicion can be enough to earn an elevated risk score. Worse, there is usually no easy way to get off the list, even as people\u2019s circumstances change, time passes, and the data grows stale. The people on these lists, and most impacted by these risks, are primarily young men of colour. This reality raises serious constitutional concerns and threatens to delegitimise person-based pre\u00addictive policing strategies. </p><p><em> Excerpted from The Rise of Big Data Policing: Surveillance, Race, and the Future of Law Enforcement.

                            "text": "IN 1962 a British political scientist, Bernard Crick, published \u201cIn Defence of Politics\u201d. He argued that the art of political horse-trading, far from being shabby, lets people of different beliefs live together in a peaceful, thriving society. In a liberal democracy, nobody gets exactly what he wants, but everyone broadly has the freedom to lead the life he chooses. However, without decent information, civility and conciliation, societies resolve their differences by resorting to coercion.\nHow Crick would have been dismayed by the falsehood and partisanship on display in this week\u2019s Senate committee hearings in Washington. Not long ago social media held out the promise of a more enlightened politics, as accurate information and effortless communication helped good people drive out corruption, bigotry and lies. Yet Facebook acknowledged that before and after last year\u2019s American election, between January 2015 and August this year, 146m users may have seen Russian misinformation on its platform. Google\u2019s YouTube admitted to 1,108 Russian-linked videos and Twitter to 36,746 accounts. Far from bringing enlightenment, social media have been spreading poison.\nRussia\u2019s trouble-making is only the start. From South Africa to Spain, politics is getting uglier. Part of the reason is that, by spreading untruth and outrage, corroding voters\u2019 judgment and aggravating partisanship, social media erode the conditions for the horse-trading that Crick thought fosters liberty.\n\nA SHORTER ATTENTION SPA...OH, LOOK AT THAT!\nThe use of social media does not cause division so much as amplify it. The financial crisis of 2007-08 stoked popular anger at a wealthy elite that had left everyone else behind. The culture wars have split voters by identity rather than class. Nor are social media alone in their power to polarise\u2014just look at cable TV and talk radio. But, whereas Fox News is familiar, social-media platforms are new and still poorly understood. And, because of how they work, they wield extraordinary influence.\nThey make their money by putting photos, personal posts, news stories and ads in front of you. Because they can measure how you react, they know just how to get under your skin (see  article  ). They collect data about you in order to have algorithms to determine what will catch your eye, in an \u201cattention economy\u201d that keeps users scrolling, clicking and sharing\u2014again and again and again. Anyone setting out to shape opinion can produce dozens of ads, analyse them and see which is hardest to resist. The result is compelling: one study found that users in rich countries touch their phones 2,600 times a day.\nIt would be wonderful if such a system helped wisdom and truth rise to the surface. But, whatever Keats said, truth is not beauty so much as it is hard work\u2014especially when you disagree with it. Everyone who has scrolled through Facebook knows how, instead of imparting wisdom, the system dishes out compulsive stuff that tends to reinforce people\u2019s biases.\nThis aggravates the politics of contempt that took hold, in the United States at least, in the 1990s. Because different sides see different facts, they share no empirical basis for reaching a compromise. Because each side hears time and again that the other lot are good for nothing but lying, bad faith and slander, the system has even less room for empathy. Because people are sucked into a maelstrom of pettiness, scandal and outrage, they lose sight of what matters for the society they share.\nThis tends to discredit the compromises and subtleties of liberal democracy, and to boost the politicians who feed off conspiracy and nativism. Consider the probes into Russia\u2019s election hack by Congress and the special prosecutor, Robert Mueller, who has just issued his first indictments. After Russia attacked America, Americans ended up attacking each other (see  article  ). Because the framers of the constitution wanted to hold back tyrants and mobs, social media aggravate Washington gridlock. In Hungary and Poland, without such constraints, they help sustain an illiberal, winner-takes-all style of democracy. In Myanmar, where Facebook is the main source of news for many, it has deepened the hatred of the Rohingya, victims of ethnic cleansing.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA, SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\nWhat is to be done? People will adapt, as they always do. A survey this week found that only 37% of Americans trust what they get from social media, half the share that trust printed newspapers and magazines. Yet in the time it takes to adapt, bad governments with bad politics could do a lot of harm.\nSociety has created devices, such as libel, and ownership laws, to rein in old media. Some are calling for social-media companies, like publishers, to be similarly accountable for what appears on their platforms; to be more transparent; and to be treated as monopolies that need breaking up.

Yet Facebook acknowledged that before and after last year\u2019s American election, between January 2015 and August this year, 146m users may have seen Russian misinformation on its platform. Google\u2019s YouTube admitted to 1,108 Russian-linked videos and Twitter to 36,746 accounts.

Because different sides see different facts, they share no empirical basis for reaching a compromise. Because each side hears time and again that the other lot are good for nothing but lying, bad faith and slander, the system has even less room for empathy. Because people are sucked into a maelstrom of pettiness, scandal and outrage, they lose sight of what matters for the society they share. </p><p> This tends to discredit the compromises and subtleties of liberal democracy, and to boost the politicians who feed off conspiracy and nativism.

                            "text": "NEW YORK : Publisher Gannett plans to include generative artificial intelligence in the system it uses to publish stories as it and other news organizations begin to roll out the popular technology that may help save money and improve efficiency.\nBut the largest U.S. newspaper publisher with over 200 daily outlets said it will include humans in the process so that the technology can\u2019t be deployed automatically, without oversight. Generative AI is a way to create efficiencies and eliminate some tedious tasks for journalists, Renn Turiano, senior vice president and head of product at Gannett said in a recent interview with Reuters.\nHowever, Turiano added, \u201cThe desire to go fast was a mistake for some of the other news services,\u201d he said without singling out a specific outlet. \u201cWe\u2019re not making that mistake.\u201d\nGannett is hardly alone in its balancing act. For instance Reuters President Paul Bascobert said in a statement Thursday, responding to a reporter's request for comment about the company\u2019s plans, that as the news agency embraces AI technologies, it is \"taking a responsible approach that safeguards accuracy and fosters trust.\u201d\nMany U.S. newsrooms are grappling with how best to incorporate AI tools that generate new content or data in response to a prompt, or question, by a user.\nBut generative AI's limitations, which include the tendency to \u201challucinate,\u201d or serve up misinformation with a veneer of certainty, are particularly problematic in an industry that demands accuracy, some experts say.\n\u201cWhere I am right now is I wouldn\u2019t recommend these models for any journalistic use case where you\u2019re publishing automatically to a public channel,\u201d said Northwestern University associate professor Nicholas Diakopoulos.\nGannett\u2019s strategy reflects the measured approach a number of mainstream newsrooms are taking.\nTheir caution follows well-publicized generative AI gaffes at media outlets including CNET and Men\u2019s Journal. Both publications used the technology to generate stories that contained factual errors.\nNext quarter Gannett will roll out a live pilot program using AI to identify the most important points of an article and create bulleted summaries at the top of it. It will launch that feature in the fourth quarter at USA Today. Journalists will have the final say, deciding whether to use what the AI proposed.

China claims most of the strategic waterway - which is disputed by four ASEAN states and Taiwan - and has built military installations on artificial reefs in contested island chains to bolster its territorial assertions.\nChina has also  released a new map laying claims  over large swathes of disputed areas in the South China Sea, triggering protests by Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines.\nIn his speech, Mr Lee urged ASEAN and China to intensify efforts to conclude a Code of Conduct that is in accordance with international law - like the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea - and safeguards the \"rights and interests of all parties\".\nAt an ASEAN Foreign Ministers\u2019 meeting in July, ASEAN and China agreed on guidelines to  accelerate negotiations on this code of conduct  , which would act as a framework for resolving disputes.\nNegotiations, originally planned to be concluded in 2021, had stalled due to various reasons including the pandemic.\nUnderscoring how ASEAN-China cooperation can help both sides to build trust and confidence to address challenging issues like the South China Sea  ,  Mr Lee noted that officials have started negotiations on upgrading the ASEAN-China Free Trade Area to cover emerging areas such as the digital and green economies.\nHe suggested that ASEAN and China further liberalise their air transport agreement to encourage more people-to-people exchanges, and cooperate on digital economy to make cross-border transactions seamless and sustainable.\nThese initiatives support the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP), Mr Lee said, urging the regions to continue pursuing tangible cooperation in the priority areas of maritime, economic, connectivity and Sustainable Development Goals.\nDuring the ASEAN-US Summit, Mr Lee said the AOIP can be used to explore and deepen ASEAN-US cooperation.\n\"We welcome the efforts of this US administration to enhance cooperation with ASEAN,\" he said, noting the US' support for the region's green energy transition and cybersecurity.\nBut Mr Lee said the role of the US has become \"more critical\" at a time of troubling geopolitics, highlighting that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is a continuing problem for the world.\nA longer-term concern, he said, is the US-China relationship, with Southeast Asia concerned that a miscalculation could draw the region into serious conflict.\n\"One potential flashpoint is the South China Sea, which is a shared resource for all of us,\" he said.\nMr Lee said the rights of all states to freedom of navigation and overflight in the disputed waterway should be maintained, as he again called for a code of conduct that is aligned with international law.\n\"ASEAN\u2019s response to this geostrategic situation is to strengthen our ties with all the major powers,\" he added.\n\nCHINA SAYS IT PURSUES PEACE, US SAYS COMMITTED TO ASEAN CENTRALITY\nDuring the opening remarks, Chinese Premier Mr Li touted the advanced trade relations and \"brotherly ties\" between ASEAN and China, pointing to their elevated comprehensive strategic partnership as a \"strong testament\" of strategic trust between the two.\n\"No matter how the international situation evolves, China and ASEAN have maintained close exchanges and communication, respected each other's development path and accommodated each other's major concerns,\" he said.\n\"We have preserved peace and tranquillity in East Asia in a world fraught with turbulence and change.\"\nHe also pointed out how China has reached \"important consensus\" separately with six ASEAN countries on building a community with their shared future based on a concept introduced by Mr Xi in 2013.\n\"And we hope to do so with more countries in the future,\" said Mr Li, without naming the countries though earlier media reports in July identified them as Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia.\nDuring the ASEAN-US Summit, Ms Harris said the US is committed to ASEAN centrality, as she announced plans to set up the first-ever ASEAN-US Center in Washington DC.\nThe centre, established through a public-private partnership, will support official ASEAN engagements as well as exchanges between businesses and academic institutions.\n\"We have a shared commitment to international rules and norms, and to our partnership in national and regional issues such as the crisis in Myanmar,\" she said.\nMs Harris said the US will continue to press the Myanmar regime to end the \"horrific\" violence, release those who are unjustly detained, and re-establish the country's path to inclusive democracy.\n\"I believe as leaders, we must address global challenges of today, while also investing in a long-term vision,\" she added.\n\"The United States and the nations of Southeast Asia share many long-term interests and priorities as well as a long-term vision.\"\n\nKOREAN PENINSULA SITUATION \"WORRYING\"\nIn separate summits on Wednesday, ASEAN leaders also met with South Korea President Yoon Suk-yeol and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.\nMr Lee said the situation in the Korean Peninsula situation remains \"worrying\", and that Singapore has consistently and strongly condemned North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missile launches, most recently in July.\n\"These have further raised tensions on the peninsula and violated UNSC (United Nations Security Council) resolutions,\" he said.\nMr Yoon on Tuesday had  called on Southeast Asian nations to \"join forces\"  in responding to North Korea's nuclear threats, as Washington warned Pyongyang's leader Kim Jong Un was  set to make a rare trip to Russia  for arms talks.\n\"Singapore will continue to work with the international community to promote peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula,\" Mr Lee said.",

MyGoPen is named after a homophone in the Taiwanese dialect for \"don't fool me again\".\nCitizens have sought out fact-checking help, such as when a recent uproar over imported eggs raised questions about videos showing black and green yolks, Hsieh said. Such demand would have been unthinkable in 2018, when the heated emotions and damaging rumors around a contentious referendum inspired the founders of Fake News Cleaner.\n\"Now, everyone will stop and think: 'This seems odd. Can you help me check this? We suspect something,'\" Hsieh said. \"This, I think, is an improvement.\"\nStill, fact-checking in Taiwan remains complicated. False claims swirled recently around Lai, an outspoken critic of Beijing, and his visit to Paraguay this summer.\nFact-checkers found that a memo at the center of one claim had been manipulated, with changed dates and dollar figures. Another claim originated on an English-language forum before a new account on X, formerly known as Twitter, quoted it in Mandarin in a post that was shared by a news website in Hong Kong and boosted on Facebook by a Taiwanese politician.\nChina's disinformation work has had \"measurable effects\", including \"worsening Taiwanese political and social polarisation and widening perceived generational divides\", according to research from Rand Corp.\nConcerns about election-related fake news drove the Taiwanese government last month to set up a dedicated task force.\nIn August, Meta took down a Chinese influence campaign that it described as the largest such operation to date, with 7,704 Facebook accounts and hundreds of others across other social media platforms targeting Taiwan and other regions.\nA few months ago, an audio file that seemed to feature a rival politician criticising Lai circulated in Taiwan. The clip was almost certainly a deepfake, according to Taiwan's Ministry of Justice and AI-detection company Reality Defender.\nChinese disinformation posts appear increasingly subtle and organic, rather than flooding the zone with obvious pro-Beijing messages, researchers said. Some false narratives are created by Chinese-controlled content farms, then spread by agents, bots or unwitting social media users, researchers say.\nChina has also tried to buy established Taiwanese social media accounts and may have paid Taiwanese influencers to promote pro-Beijing narratives, according to Rand."

The long-term positive outlook has not changed,\u201d said a statement from the 24-member Politburo \u2013 the Communist Party\u2019s prime decision-making body.\nLooking forward, China\u2019s leadership has long focused on its development strategy to move away from economic growth targets and towards systemic resilience by calling for a drive for an \u201cinternal cycle\u201d in the five-year plan to 2025.\nIn his work report to the 20th party congress in October, Xi laid out the top priorities as emphasising \u201cgreen\u201d and \u201chigh-quality\u201d development, greater self-reliance and strength in science and technology, as well as improving mechanisms to promote a high-quality workforce and employment.\nChina previously included a goal to lift itself into a \u201chigh income\u201d nation by 2025 and advance to a \u201cmoderately developed\u201d nation by 2035, which implies income of more than US$20,000 per person. China\u2019s per capita GDP is around US$12,000, according to official data.\nAnd despite the current slump in a wide-range of economic indicators, Yu Miaojie, an economist who is also the president of Liaoning University, said he is confident that China would be able to reach its target.\n\u201cRight now, China\u2019s potential in being a mega-size economy and the ability to complete a full supply chain have not even been fully unleashed. With further structural reforms, it is not a problem in achieving a GDP growth of 4.5 to 5 per cent in the coming years, which would help us reach this target,\u201d said Yu, who is also a chair professor of economics at Peking University.\nBy 2035, China is also expected to become a \u201cmanufacturing superpower\u201d and a global leader in strategically important emerging industries.\nHowever, even China\u2019s traditional role as the world\u2019s leading manufacturer, exporter and top investment destination faces challenges as geopolitical tensions grow.\nThe US and its allies are calling to de-risk their supply chains away from China to reduce reliance, while the list of export controls against Chinese companies due to security concerns has been expanded.\nWhile China\u2019s trade with  neighbouring Southeast Asian countries  and developing economies has been growing, Mexico just replaced China for the first time since 2014 as the US\u2019 biggest trading partner.\n\nChina\u2019s\ninvestment\nFor foreign investors, China\u2019s newly introduced  anti-espionage law  has spurred foreign chambers of commerce to call for clarification, potentially adding more complications for companies considering moving out of China.\nAccording to a poll published by the European Chamber of Commerce in China in June, 46 per cent of 570 companies surveyed said their \u201cinvestments begin to shift out of China as de-risking strategies emerge\u201d.\nNeil Thomas, a Chinese politics fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute\u2019s Centre for China Analysis, said Xi faces a balancing act between economic growth and national security.\n\u201cXi can still grow the economy with statist and more security-focused policies, just not as much as if he leaned further into building more open and efficient markets,\u201d said Thomas.\n\u201cTo Xi Jinping, national security holds paramount importance over national and domestic security as it directly impacts his survival as a leader,\u201d said Lee.\nBut despite some analysts saying that Xi does not appear to be facing a crisis moment despite current challenges, China\u2019s competition with the US will now take place in direct comparison as its economic rebound has recovered better than expected.\nIn a closed-door economic academic seminar in July, Chinese economists said they were surprised to see the US recovery holding up.",

He argued that the art of political horse-trading, far from being shabby, lets people of different beliefs live together in a peaceful, thriving society. In a liberal democracy, nobody gets exactly what he wants, but everyone broadly has the freedom to lead the life he chooses. However, without decent information, civility and conciliation, societies resolve their differences by resorting to coercion.\nHow Crick would have been dismayed by the falsehood and partisanship on display in this week\u2019s Senate committee hearings in Washington. Not long ago social media held out the promise of a more enlightened politics, as accurate information and effortless communication helped good people drive out corruption, bigotry and lies. Yet Facebook acknowledged that before and after last year\u2019s American election, between January 2015 and August this year, 146m users may have seen Russian misinformation on its platform. Google\u2019s YouTube admitted to 1,108 Russian-linked videos and Twitter to 36,746 accounts. Far from bringing enlightenment, social media have been spreading poison.\nRussia\u2019s trouble-making is only the start. From South Africa to Spain, politics is getting uglier. Part of the reason is that, by spreading untruth and outrage, corroding voters\u2019 judgment and aggravating partisanship, social media erode the conditions for the horse-trading that Crick thought fosters liberty.\n\nA SHORTER ATTENTION SPA...OH, LOOK AT THAT!\nThe use of social media does not cause division so much as amplify it. The financial crisis of 2007-08 stoked popular anger at a wealthy elite that had left everyone else behind. The culture wars have split voters by identity rather than class. Nor are social media alone in their power to polarise\u2014just look at cable TV and talk radio. But, whereas Fox News is familiar, social-media platforms are new and still poorly understood. And, because of how they work, they wield extraordinary influence.\nThey make their money by putting photos, personal posts, news stories and ads in front of you. Because they can measure how you react, they know just how to get under your skin (see  article  ). They collect data about you in order to have algorithms to determine what will catch your eye, in an \u201cattention economy\u201d that keeps users scrolling, clicking and sharing\u2014again and again and again. Anyone setting out to shape opinion can produce dozens of ads, analyse them and see which is hardest to resist. The result is compelling: one study found that users in rich countries touch their phones 2,600 times a day.\nIt would be wonderful if such a system helped wisdom and truth rise to the surface. But, whatever Keats said, truth is not beauty so much as it is hard work\u2014especially when you disagree with it. Everyone who has scrolled through Facebook knows how, instead of imparting wisdom, the system dishes out compulsive stuff that tends to reinforce people\u2019s biases.\nThis aggravates the politics of contempt that took hold, in the United States at least, in the 1990s. Because different sides see different facts, they share no empirical basis for reaching a compromise. Because each side hears time and again that the other lot are good for nothing but lying, bad faith and slander, the system has even less room for empathy. Because people are sucked into a maelstrom of pettiness, scandal and outrage, they lose sight of what matters for the society they share.\nThis tends to discredit the compromises and subtleties of liberal democracy, and to boost the politicians who feed off conspiracy and nativism. Consider the probes into Russia\u2019s election hack by Congress and the special prosecutor, Robert Mueller, who has just issued his first indictments. After Russia attacked America, Americans ended up attacking each other (see  article  ). Because the framers of the constitution wanted to hold back tyrants and mobs, social media aggravate Washington gridlock. In Hungary and Poland, without such constraints, they help sustain an illiberal, winner-takes-all style of democracy. In Myanmar, where Facebook is the main source of news for many, it has deepened the hatred of the Rohingya, victims of ethnic cleansing.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA, SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\nWhat is to be done? People will adapt, as they always do. A survey this week found that only 37% of Americans trust what they get from social media, half the share that trust printed newspapers and magazines. Yet in the time it takes to adapt, bad governments with bad politics could do a lot of harm.\nSociety has created devices, such as libel, and ownership laws, to rein in old media. Some are calling for social-media companies, like publishers, to be similarly accountable for what appears on their platforms; to be more transparent; and to be treated as monopolies that need breaking up. All these ideas have merit, but they come with trade-offs. When Facebook farms out items to independent outfits for fact-checking, the evidence that it moderates behaviour is mixed. Moreover, politics is not like other kinds of speech; it is dangerous to ask a handful of big firms to deem what is healthy for society. Congress wants transparency about who pays for political ads, but a lot of malign influence comes through people carelessly sharing barely credible news posts. Breaking up social-media giants might make sense in antitrust terms, but it would not help with political speech\u2014indeed, by multiplying the number of platforms, it could make the industry harder to manage.\nThere are other remedies. The social-media companies should adjust their sites to make clearer if a post comes from a friend or a trusted source. They could accompany the sharing of posts with reminders of the harm from misinformation. Bots are often used to amplify political messages. Twitter could disallow the worst\u2014or mark them as such. Most powerfully, they could adapt their algorithms to put clickbait lower down the feed. Because these changes cut against a business-model designed to monopolise attention, they may well have to be imposed by law or by a regulator.\nSocial media are being abused. But, with a will, society can harness them and revive that early dream of enlightenment. The stakes for liberal democracy could hardly be higher.",

The content is directly related to the user's query about South Asian politics shaped by social media and AI.",
                    "relevant content": "IN 1962 a British political scientist, Bernard Crick, published \"In Defence of Politics\". He argued that the art of political horse-trading, far from being shabby, lets people of different beliefs live together in a peaceful, thriving society. In a liberal democracy, nobody gets exactly what he wants, but everyone broadly has the freedom to lead the life he chooses. However, without decent information, civility and conciliation, societies resolve their differences by resorting to coercion.\nHow Crick would have been dismayed by the falsehood and partisanship on display in this week's Senate committee hearings in Washington. Not long ago social media held out the promise of a more enlightened politics, as accurate information and effortless communication helped good people drive out corruption, bigotry and lies. Yet Facebook acknowledged that before and after last year's American election, between January 2015 and August this year, 146m users may have seen Russian misinformation on its platform. Google's YouTube admitted to 1,108 Russian-linked videos and Twitter to 36,746 accounts. Far from bringing enlightenment, social media have been spreading poison.\nRussia's trouble-making is only the start. From South Africa to Spain, politics is getting uglier. Part of the reason is that, by spreading untruth and outrage, corroding voters' judgment and aggravating partisanship, social media erode the conditions for the horse-trading that Crick thought fosters liberty.\n\nA SHORTER ATTENTION SPA...OH, LOOK AT THAT!\nThe use of social media does not cause division so much as amplify it. The financial crisis of 2007-08 stoked popular anger at a wealthy elite that had left everyone else behind. The culture wars have split voters by identity rather than class. Nor are social media alone in their power to polarisejust look at cable TV and talk radio. But, whereas Fox News is familiar, social-media platforms are new and still poorly understood. And, because of how they work, they wield extraordinary influence.\nThey make their money by putting photos, personal posts, news stories and ads in front of you. Because they can measure how you react, they know just how to get under your skin (see  article  ). They collect data about you in order to have algorithms to determine what will catch your eye, in an \"attention economy\" that keeps users scrolling, clicking and sharingagain and again and again. Anyone setting out to shape opinion can produce dozens of ads, analyse them and see which is hardest to resist. The result is compelling: one study found that users in rich countries touch their phones 2,600 times a day.\nIt would be wonderful if such a system helped wisdom and truth rise to the surface. But, whatever Keats said, truth is not beauty so much as it is hard workespecially when you disagree with it. Everyone who has scrolled through Facebook knows how, instead of imparting wisdom, the system dishes out compulsive stuff that tends to reinforce people's biases.\nThis aggravates the politics of contempt that took hold, in the United States at least, in the 1990s. Because different sides see different facts, they share no empirical basis for reaching a compromise. Because each side hears time and again that the other lot are good for nothing but lying, bad faith and slander, the system has even less room for empathy. Because people are sucked into a maelstrom of pettiness, scandal and outrage, they lose sight of what matters for the society they share.\nThis tends to discredit the compromises and subtleties of liberal democracy, and to boost the politicians who feed off conspiracy and nativism. Consider the probes into Russia's election hack by Congress and the special prosecutor, Robert Mueller, who has just issued his first indictments. After Russia attacked America, Americans ended up attacking each other (see  article  ). Because the framers of the constitution wanted to hold back tyrants and mobs, social media aggravate Washington gridlock. In Hungary and Poland, without such constraints, they help sustain an illiberal, winner-takes-all style of democracy. In Myanmar, where Facebook is the main source of news for many, it has deepened the hatred of the Rohingya, victims of ethnic cleansing.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA, SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\nWhat is to be done? People will adapt, as they always do. A survey this week found that only 37% of Americans trust what they get from social media, half the share that trust printed newspapers and magazines. Yet in the time it takes to adapt, bad governments with bad politics could do a lot of harm.\nSociety has created devices, such as libel, and ownership laws, to rein in old media. Some are calling for social-media companies, like publishers, to be similarly accountable for what appears on their platforms; to be more transparent; and to be treated as monopolies that need breaking up. All these ideas have merit, but they come with trade-offs. When Facebook farms out items to independent outfits for fact-checking, the evidence that it moderates behaviour is mixed. Moreover, politics is not like other kinds of speech; it is dangerous to ask a handful of big firms to deem what is healthy for society. Congress wants transparency about who pays for political ads, but a lot of malign influence comes through people carelessly sharing barely credible news posts. Breaking up social-media giants might make sense in antitrust terms, but it would not help with political speechindeed, by multiplying the number of platforms, it could make the industry harder to manage.\nThere are other remedies. The social-media companies should adjust their sites to make clearer if a post comes from a friend or a trusted source. They could accompany the sharing of posts with reminders of the harm from misinformation. Bots are often used to amplify political messages. Twitter could disallow the worstor mark them as such. Most powerfully, they could adapt their algorithms to put clickbait lower down the feed. Because these changes cut against a business-model designed to monopolise attention, they may well have to be imposed by law or by a regulator.\nSocial media are being abused. But, with a will, society can harness them and revive that early dream of enlightenment. The stakes for liberal democracy could hardly be higher."

What has the weird world of particle entanglement and superposition to do with the struggle for technological supremacy in the 21st century? A breakthrough announced by a team of researchers at Google has drawn worldwide attention to this question.\nIt turns out the tiniest realm known to the human mind has enormous implications for national security, commerce, medicine, weapons and basically everything to do with computers and networks. That is because quantum computing has the potential to be faster and more powerful by many orders of magnitude than the greatest supercomputer in existence. No wonder China, the US and the European Union  three of the world's largest economies  are competing fiercely for this hi-tech holy grail."

In January, the Netherlands and Japan were reported to be joining in the restrictions on exports of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China, but details are presently scant.\nMeanwhile, China has launched a trade dispute in the World Trade Organisation over the US\u2019 export controls.\nWill the US choke off China\u2019s rise in artificial intelligence (AI), supercomputing as well as its AI-related military advancements? Or will it supercharge Beijing\u2019s bid to be a technological superpower?\nThe programme  Insight  examines a face-off that could have far-reaching implications for Asia, which manufactures the bulk of the world\u2019s microchips.\nChips are \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d for almost everything we use in our daily lives, such as smartphones and vacuum cleaners, said Ryu Yongwook, an assistant professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, who specialises in international relations.\nA chip, also called a microchip, is a set of electronic circuits on a small piece of silicon, according to Dutch firm ASML, which makes lithography or projection systems that are essential to chipmaking.\nWATCH: US\u2019 chip war on China \u2014 will China win or lose the tech race? (47:44)\n\nRyu reckoned that Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s Made in China 2025 plan, announced in 2015, to achieve 70 per cent self-sufficiency in semiconductor production by 2025 \u201calarmed\u201d the US government.\n\u201cThe concern was not only China\u2019s tech rise, but the pace at which China\u2019s tech rise was taking place. And at the same time, the US-China strategic rivalry was intensifying,\u201d he noted.\n\nWHAT THE EXPORT CONTROLS ARE ABOUT\nThe US\u2019 countermeasures have been broad. US companies are barred from supplying advanced chips and chipmaking equipment to China unless they receive a special licence. But licences would be mostly denied, the US authorities said.\nCompanies anywhere in the world will also be barred from selling chips used in AI and supercomputing in China if they are made with US technology and software, the New York Times reported.\nUS citizens and \u201cresident aliens\u201d, including green card holders, may not work on or support the production of advanced semiconductors for China.\nSingaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in October that the Biden administration\u2019s move is \u201ca very serious one\u201d and could have \u201cvery wide ramifications\u201d.\nRyu said: \u201cThe USA has identified a critical area that could hurt China badly. And the USA also knows that China doesn\u2019t have many other options to respond to this.\u201d\n\nCurrently, China consumes more than 50 per cent of global chips as the manufacturing hub of the world. But it manufactures only around 15 per cent of global output, he cited.\nChina lacks the capacity to manufacture advanced chips at 7 nanometres and below \u2014 a nanometre is one thousand millionth of a metre  \u2014  and its reliance on imports from places like Taiwan and South Korea is \u201c100 per cent\u201d, added Ryu.\nAnd although Asia \u2014 namely Taiwan, Japan, South Korea and China \u2014 manufactures over 70 per cent of the world\u2019s chips, US companies are market leaders in activities that are most research-intensive, according to the US\u2019 Semiconductor Industry Association.\nThese activities are electronic design automation and core intellectual property (72 per cent), chip design (49 per cent), and manufacturing equipment (42 per cent), according to the association\u2019s 2022 State of the US Semiconductor Industry report.\nLast August, the US also enacted the Chips and Science Act, allocating US$52.7 billion (S$70 billion) over five years for semiconductor research, development, manufacturing and workforce development in the country.\n\nWhy? Because the only way to \u2026 grow their semiconductor businesses \u2026 is to work closely with their largest customer, that is China. How can anyone in the world truly believe they can maximise their own benefit by killing their largest customer?\u201d\n\nAs for military-civil fusion, he thinks Chinese companies are \u201cdoing what they\u2019re supposed to do\u201d. He said: \u201cIn the philosophical sense, everything you produce can be used by either the civilian side \u2026 or by the military side of the equation.\u201d\nSome pessimistic reports project that the ban could set China\u2019s tech industry back by decades. But there are analysts and industry players who believe China will close the technological gap in the longer term and become self-sufficient in semiconductors.\nIn December, Reuters cited three sources who said China was working on a support package worth more than 1 trillion yuan (S$193 billion) to boost chips production and research.\nThe \u201cshort-term difficulties\u201d created by the US\u2019 chip ban will \u201cmotivate us to fight\u201d, said Song Lijun, the CEO of Shenzhen Winsemi Microelectronics.",

                            "text": "From sharks to ice shelves, monsoons to volcanoes, the scope of ocean monitoring is widening\nIN NOVEMBER 2016 a large crack appeared in the Larsen C ice shelf off Antarctica (pictured). By July 2017 a chunk a quarter of the size of Wales, weighing one trillion tonnes, broke off from the main body of the shelf and started drifting away into the Southern Ocean. The shelf is already floating, so even such a large iceberg detaching itself did not affect sea levels. But Larsen C buttresses a much larger mass of ice that sits upon the Antarctic continent. If it breaks up completely, as its two smaller siblings (Larsens A and B) have done over the past 20 years, that ice on shore could flow much more easily into the ocean. If it did so\u2014and scientists believe it would\u2014that ice alone could account for 10cm of sea-level rise, more than half of the total rise seen in the 20th century.\nThe dynamics of the process, known as calving, that causes a shelf to break up are obscure. That, however, may soon change. Ocean Infinity, a marine-survey firm based in Texas, is due to send two autonomous drones under the Larsen C shelf in 2019, the first subglacial survey of its kind. \u201cIt is probably the least accessible and least explored area on the globe,\u201d says Julian Dowdeswell, a glaciologist at the University of Cambridge who will lead the scientific side of the project.\nThe drones set to explore Larsen C look like 6-metre orange cigars and are made by Kongsberg\u2014the same Norwegian firm that runs the new open-ocean fish farms. Called Hugin, after one of the ravens who flew around the world gathering information for Odin, a Norse god, the drones are designed to cruise precisely planned routes to investigate specific objects people already know about, such as oil pipelines, or to find things that they care about, such as missing planes. With lithium-ion-battery systems about as big as those found in a Tesla saloon the drones can travel at four knots for 60 hours on a charge, which gives them a range of about 400km. Their sensors will measure how the temperature of the water varies. Their sonar\u2014which in this case, unusually, looks upwards\u2014will measure the roughness of the bottom of the ice. Both variables are crucial in assessing how fast the ice shelf is breaking up, says Dr Dowdeswell.\nThe ability to see bits of the ocean, and things which it contains, that were previously invisible does not just matter to miners and submariners. It matters to scientists, environmentalists and fisheries managers. It helps them understand the changing Earth, predict the weather\u2014including its dangerous extremes\u2014and maintain fish stocks and protect other wildlife. Drones of all shapes and sizes are hoping to provide far more such information than has ever been available before.\nSaildrone, a Californian marine-robotics startup, is looking at the problem of managing fish stocks. Its tools are robot sailing boats covered with sensors which it builds at something more like a factory than a shipyard on the island of Alameda in San Francisco Bay. These 7-metre, half-tonne vessels\u2014it has so far built 20 of them, one of which is shown on the cover of this quarterly\u2014are designed to ply the seas autonomously, using carbon-fibre wings as their sails. The wing has a fin attached to it which keeps it trim to the wind at all times. Its on-board computer (which has a GPS-equipped autopilot), its sensors and its radio get their modest 30 watts of power from lithium-ion batteries topped up by energy from solar panels whenever the sun is out.\nOne of the first hubs deploying these drones is at Dutch Harbor on Amaknak Island in Alaska; at any given time three of the boats based there are off monitoring a large pollock fishery in the Bering Sea, something they can do autonomously for up to a year before returning for maintenance. They gather data using echo-sounders designed by Simrad, a subsidiary of Kongsberg. Because each species of fish reflects different frequencies of sound in its own way (often because their swim bladders resonate differently) a sonar which emits a wide range of frequencies, as the wideband Simrad devices do, can tell what is a pollock and what is not.\nNever mind the pollock\nThe drones supplement the fisheries\u2019 main survey ship, which counts the pollock at the beginning of every season in order to determine how many fish can be caught. Their data give it a better sense of where to look. Sebastien de Halleux, Saildrone\u2019s chief operating officer, says they also find more pollock, providing a count 25% higher than that of the official survey vessel. This may be because the drones cause less disturbance and drive fewer fish away. In time he thinks the drones might go beyond helping the existing system and do the job on their own, which would be a lot cheaper.\nPollock are good to eat, and if fisheries are managed sustainably they will remain so in perpetuity. But they are hardly the most exciting fish to monitor. That honour must surely go to the great white shark. Jayson Semmens, a marine biologist at the University of Tasmania in Australia, is using a new generation of sensor tags to study the behaviour of these fearsome fish in more detail than was possible before\u2014not to protect people, as shark attacks are very rare, but to build a scientific understanding of their metabolism. He uses accelerometer data from a tag the size of a grain of rice, attached to the shark\u2019s fin with a clamp, to calculate the energy it expends when it breaches out of the water.\nThe tags are too small to have enough power to send their data straight back to base. But they do not need to be retrieved directly from the shark (which is probably just as well). Their attachments dissolve over the course of their life, so in time they float free, rising to the surface and emitting a simple signal that allows them to be found. Armed with the data they record, Dr Semmens can calculate the fish\u2019s total energy needs, and thus how much prey a single shark requires. That can be used to gain an understanding of the flow of energy through the food chain, which is basic to understanding the dynamics of the ecosystem. The flow of energy through terrestrial ecosystems is comparatively easy to study; marine ones are more mysterious.\nA tiny sensor that measures a shark\u2019s metabolism seems remarkable\u2014but at heart it is no more so than a modern phone. \u201cThe accelerometer I use to measure great white shark activity,\u201d says Dr Semmens, \u201cis the same one you use to turn your smartphone into a lightsabre.\u201d Such tiny tags, which can also measure the temperature and pressure of the surrounding water, are a big step up from the bulky tags of yesteryear, which would provide a single acoustic frequency that allowed researchers to follow the fish if they were close enough. And they are improving rapidly. \u201cPeople are talking about tags which sample blood from animals underwater,\u201d says Dr Semmens.\nThe same technology can be used for environmental monitoring as well as pure science. Dr Semmens has tagged several endangered Maugean skate in Tasmania\u2019s Macquarie harbour with somewhat larger sensors\u2014they weigh 60 grams, instead of 10\u2014that measure heart rate and the dissolved oxygen content of the water. Parts of the harbour are becoming anoxic\u2014deprived of oxygen\u2014because of large-scale near-shore salmon farming. The data from the skate show how much of this is going on, and how much harm it is doing. That makes it easier to argue for changes that boost conservation efforts.\nOne of the biggest benefits of better measured seas is the possibility of getting to grips with dramatic weather events. The top 3 metres of the oceans hold more heat energy than the entire atmosphere. How much of that energy escapes into the air, and when and where it does so, drives the strength and frequency of storm systems. And there is ever more energy to do that driving. The average surface temperature of the seas has risen by about 0.9\u00b0C (1.6\u00b0F) in the past hundred years, according to America\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This means that, since the 1980s, about a billion times the heat energy of the atom bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki has been added to the ocean\u2014roughly an atomic explosion every few seconds.\nYet even as the amount of energy the oceans hold has risen, the details of its transfer to the atmosphere remain unknown for large swathes of the ocean. This is particularly important when it comes to understanding something like the South Asian monsoon. The rains are driven by the huge size of the Bay of Bengal and the amount of fresh water that pours into it from the Ganges and Brahmaputra river systems. Because this buoyant fresh water cannot easily mix with the denser salty water below it, the surface gets very warm indeed, driving prodigious amounts of evaporation. Better understanding these processes would improve monsoon forecasts\u2014and could help predict cyclones, too.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s hotter under the water\nTo this end Amala Mahadevan of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) in Massachusetts, has been working with the Indian weather agencies to install a string of sensors hanging down off a buoy in the northern end of the Bay of Bengal.\nA large bank of similar buoys called the Pioneer Array has been showing oceanographers things they have not seen before in the two years it has been operating off the coast of New England. The array is part of the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) funded by America\u2019s National Science Foundation. It is providing a three-dimensional picture of changes to the Gulf Stream, which is pushing as much as 100km closer to the shore than it used to. \u201cFishermen are catching Gulf Stream fish 100km in from the continental shelf,\u201d says Glen Gawarkiewicz of WHOI. These data make local weather forecasting better.\nThree other lines of buoys and floats have recently been installed across the Atlantic in order to understand the transfer of deep water from the North Atlantic southwards, a flow which is fundamental to the dynamics of all the world\u2019s oceans, and which may falter in a warmer climate.\nAnother part of the OOI is the Cabled Array off the coast of Oregon. Its sensors, which span one of the smallest of the world\u2019s tectonic plates, the Juan de Fuca plate, are connected by 900km of fibre-optic cable and powered by electricity cables that run out from the shore. The array is designed to gather data which will help understand the connections between the plate\u2019s volcanic activity and the biological and oceanographic processes above it.\nA set of sensors off Japan takes a much more practical interest in plate tectonics. The Dense Oceanfloor Network System for Earthquakes and Tsunamis (DONET) consists of over 50 sea-floor observing stations, each housing pressure sensors which show whether the sea floor is rising or falling, as well as seismometers which measure the direct movement caused by an earthquake. When the plates shift and the sea floor trembles, they can send signals racing back to shore at the speed of light in glass, beating the slower progress of the seismic waves through the Earth\u2019s crust, to give people a few valuable extra seconds of warning. Better measuring of climate can save lives over decades; prompt measurement of earthquakes can save them in an instant.",

Perhaps most provocative is China\u2019s devotion to the \u201cnine-dash line\u201d, an ill-defined swish of the pen around the South China Sea. Within this perimeter, China claims all the dry land and, it appears, all the water and seabed too; by way of contrast, the rules of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) would tend to see quite a lot of those things as subject to claims from other countries. Speaking in June at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual regional-security shindig in Singapore, Wang Guanzhong, a Chinese general, made it clear that although China respected UNCLOS, the convention could not apply retroactively: the nine-dash line was instituted in the 1940s and the islands of the South China Sea have been Chinese for 2,000 years.\nOthers in China have been blunter. Wu Shicun, head of the National Institute for South China Seas Studies, based on the southern Chinese island of Hainan, recently pointed out that UNCLOS was developed under Western guidance and that, looking to the long term, \u201cwe should rebuild through various methods of regional co-operation a more reasonable, fairer and more just international maritime order that is guided by us.\u201d Not surprisingly, this has caused concern in Washington. \u201cHow much of the temple do they actually want to tear down?\u201d asks Douglas Paal, a former American official now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\nProbably not all that much, for now. But \u201cChina gets it that being a great power is messy, and involves trampling on a few flowers,\u201d says Lyle Goldstein of America\u2019s Naval War College. \u201cIt is a price the Chinese are willing to pay.\u201d Rules such as those which say the nine-dash line must be respected might be acceptable for the small fry. But as China\u2019s then foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, vocally pointed out at a meeting of regional powers in Hanoi in 2010, \u201cChina is a big country and other countries are small countries and that is a fact.\u201d\nMilitarily, this is indeed the case. China\u2019s armed forces are, if not technologically first-rate, certainly large and impressive, not least because they include a nuclear-missile force. But some of Mr Yang\u2019s small countries have a big friend. With troops and bases in Japan and South Korea, America has been the dominant power of the western Pacific for 70 years. Its regional presence has not declined much since it won the cold war a quarter of a century ago. On a trip to Asia in 2011 Barack Obama announced a \u201cpivot\u201d of his country\u2019s policy away from the Middle East and towards Asia.\nChina\u2019s leaders are convinced that America is determined to prevent their country from increasing its strategic and military influence in Asia\u2014that it is trying to contain China as it once sought to contain and eventually crush the Soviet Union. The irony is that China is the only country that really believes the pivot is happening. South-East Asian nations express a fair amount of scepticism at the idea that America\u2019s attention has been newly fixed on their region, and his opponents in America claim Mr Obama has done far too little to follow through on what he said in 2011.\nThat said, the recent Shangri-La Dialogue did nothing to dispel China\u2019s fears. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, offered to assist China\u2019s neighbours with military hardware, and has been pushing, within the constraints of Japan\u2019s pacifist post-war constitution, for a more robust defence policy in the region. In his first year in office Mr Abe visited every member of the Association of South-East Asian Nations. America\u2019s secretary of defence, Chuck Hagel, endorsed Mr Abe\u2019s ideas at Shangri-La, accusing China of \u201cdestabilising unilateral actions\u201d.\nChina has been assertive in the South China Sea for decades, but there has been a distinct hardening of its position since Mr Xi came to power. Recent moves to dominate the seas within the \u201cfirst island chain\u201d that runs from Okinawa through Taiwan to the Spratlys (see map) have alienated almost all the country\u2019s neighbours. \u201cIt would be hard to construct a foreign policy better designed to undermine China\u2019s long-term interests,\u201d argues Brad Glosserman of the Pacific Forum CSIS, a think-tank.\nThe moves are undoubtedly motivated in part by a desire to control the resources of the sea bed. But China itself does not see them as straightforward territorial expansionism. Chinese leaders believe their own rhetoric about the islands of the East and South China Seas having always been part of their territory\u2013a territory that, since the death of Mao, they have chosen to define as almost the empire\u2019s maximum extent under the Qing dynasty, rather than its more modest earlier size. And if they are expressing this territorial interest aggressively, they are behaving no worse\u2014in their eyes, better\u2014than the only other power they see as their match. The Chinese note that America is hardly an unsullied protector of that temple of the global international order; it enjoys the great-power prerogatives and dispensations they seek for their own nation. Disliking the restraints of international treaties perhaps even more than China does, America has not itself ratified UNCLOS. With a handful of allies it rode roughshod over the international legal system to invade Iraq.\n\nVIDEO\nChina might also note parallels between its ambitions and those of America\u2019s in days gone by. Although America waited until the early 20th century to take on a global role, it defined an ambitious regional role a hundred years earlier. In 1823 James Monroe laid out as policy a refusal to countenance any interference in the Western hemisphere by European nations; all incursions would be treated as acts of aggression. Conceptually, what China wants in East Asia seems akin to a Monroe Doctrine: a decrease in the influence of external powers that would allow it untroubled regional dominance. The difference is that the 19th-century Americas did not have any home-grown powers to challenge the United States, and most of its nations were quite content with the idea of keeping European great powers out of the area. At least in its early years, they were the doctrine\u2019s beneficiaries, not its subjects.\nChina is not completely uncompromising. Along its land borders it has let some disputes fade away and offered a bit of give and take. But this is in part because the South and East China Seas are seen as more strategically important. A key part of this strategic importance is the possibility that, eventually, the question of Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty will come to a head; it is in effect protecting its flanks in case of a future clash with America on the matter. The ever-volatile situation in North Korea could also create a flashpoint between the two states.\nWhen Mr Xi said, at his 2013 California summit with Mr Obama, that \u201cthe vast Pacific has enough space for two large countries like the United States and China,\u201d it was an expression not so much of the possibility of peaceful coexistence that must surely come from being separated by 10,000km of water, as of the idea that the western Pacific was a legitimate Chinese sphere of influence.\nAnd if Mr Xi\u2019s words, repeated to America\u2019s secretary of state, John Kerry, in Beijing in July, seemed to imply a symmetry between the countries, China knows that, in fact, it enjoys various asymmetric advantages. For one, it is a unitary actor. It can drive wedges between America and its allies in the region. Hugh White, an Australian academic, argued in a recent article that, by threatening other Asian countries with force, \u201cChina confronts America with the choice between deserting its friends and fighting China.\u201d\nChina\u2019s armed forces are much less proficient than America\u2019s. But China enjoys the advantage of playing at home. America can dominate these seas only through naval and air operations. If Chinese anti-ship missiles present a serious threat to such operations they can greatly reduce America\u2019s ability to project power, without putting China to the expense of developing a navy of its own remotely so capable. Thus the military forces of the two sides are not as unbalanced as one might think by simply counting carrier groups (of which China is building its first, whereas America has ten, four of them in the Pacific).\nChina also thinks there is an asymmetry of will. It sees a war-weary America as unlikely to spend blood and treasure defending uninhabited rocks of no direct strategic importance. America may speak loudly, but its big stick will remain unwielded. China\u2019s people, on the other hand, their views shaped not just by propaganda but also by a nationalism that needs scant encouragement, look on the projection of power in the China seas very favourably. And its military-industrial complex yearns to be paid to build bigger, better sticks of its own. Even if party leaders wanted to succeed in their stated desire for a peaceful rise and to remain within international law, the way they have shaped the spirit of their country would not necessarily let them.\nThis is especially true when it comes to Japan, the country which took on the role of regional power in Asia when China was laid low in the 19th century, and with which relations would always be most vexed. The vitriolic propaganda against the Japanese in Chinese media scarcely needs official prompting; Chinese suffering under Japan\u2019s cruel occupation is well remembered. Japan is a useful whipping boy to distract attention from the party\u2019s inadequacies. China\u2019s leaders have legitimate security concerns and a right to seek a larger international role for their nation but, obsessed with their own narrative of victimhood, they do not see that they themselves are becoming Asia\u2019s bullies.",

Recent moves to dominate the seas within the \"first island chain\" that runs from Okinawa through Taiwan to the Spratlys (see map) have alienated almost all the country's neighbours. \"It would be hard to construct a foreign policy better designed to undermine China's long-term interests,\" argues Brad Glosserman of the Pacific Forum CSIS, a think-tank.\nThe moves are undoubtedly motivated in part by a desire to control the resources of the sea bed. But China itself does not see them as straightforward territorial expansionism. Chinese leaders believe their own rhetoric about the islands of the East and South China Seas having always been part of their territorya territory that, since the death of Mao, they have chosen to define as almost the empire's maximum extent under the Qing dynasty, rather than its more modest earlier size. And if they are expressing this territorial interest aggressively, they are behaving no worsein their eyes, betterthan the only other power they see as their match. The Chinese note that America is hardly an unsullied protector of that temple of the global international order; it enjoys the great-power prerogatives and dispensations they seek for their own nation. Disliking the restraints of international treaties perhaps even more than China does, America has not itself ratified UNCLOS. With a handful of allies it rode roughshod over the international legal system to invade Iraq.\n\nVIDEO\nChina might also note parallels between its ambitions and those of America's in days gone by. Although America waited until the early 20th century to take on a global role, it defined an ambitious regional role a hundred years earlier. In 1823 James Monroe laid out as policy a refusal to countenance any interference in the Western hemisphere by European nations; all incursions would be treated as acts of aggression. Conceptually, what China wants in East Asia seems akin to a Monroe Doctrine: a decrease in the influence of external powers that would allow it untroubled regional dominance. The difference is that the 19th-century Americas did not have any home-grown powers to challenge the United States, and most of its nations were quite content with the idea of keeping European great powers out of the area. At least in its early years, they were the doctrine's beneficiaries, not its subjects.\nChina is not completely uncompromising. Along its land borders it has let some disputes fade away and offered a bit of give and take. But this is in part because the South and East China Seas are seen as more strategically important. A key part of this strategic importance is the possibility that, eventually, the question of Taiwan's sovereignty will come to a head; it is in effect protecting its flanks in case of a future clash with America on the matter. The ever-volatile situation in North Korea could also create a flashpoint between the two states.\nWhen Mr Xi said, at his 2013 California summit with Mr Obama, that \"the vast Pacific has enough space for two large countries like the United States and China,\" it was an expression not so much of the possibility of peaceful coexistence that must surely come from being separated by 10,000km of water, as of the idea that the western Pacific was a legitimate Chinese sphere of influence.\nAnd if Mr Xi's words, repeated to America's secretary of state, John Kerry, in Beijing in July, seemed to imply a symmetry between the countries, China knows that, in fact, it enjoys various asymmetric advantages. For one, it is a unitary actor. It can drive wedges between America and its allies in the region. Hugh White, an Australian academic, argued in a recent article that, by threatening other Asian countries with force, \"China confronts America with the choice between deserting its friends and fighting China.\"\nChina's armed forces are much less proficient than America's. But China enjoys the advantage of playing at home. America can dominate these seas only through naval and air operations. If Chinese anti-ship missiles present a serious threat to such operations they can greatly reduce America's ability to project power, without putting China to the expense of developing a navy of its own remotely so capable. Thus the military forces of the two sides are not as unbalanced as one might think by simply counting carrier groups (of which China is building its first, whereas America has ten, four of them in the Pacific).\nChina also thinks there is an asymmetry of will. It sees a war-weary America as unlikely to spend blood and treasure defending uninhabited rocks of no direct strategic importance. America may speak loudly, but its big stick will remain unwielded. China's people, on the other hand, their views shaped not just by propaganda but also by a nationalism that needs scant encouragement, look on the projection of power in the China seas very favourably. And its military-industrial complex yearns to be paid to build bigger, better sticks of its own. Even if party leaders wanted to succeed in their stated desire for a peaceful rise and to remain within international law, the way they have shaped the spirit of their country would not necessarily let them.\nThis is especially true when it comes to Japan, the country which took on the role of regional power in Asia when China was laid low in the 19th century, and with which relations would always be most vexed. The vitriolic propaganda against the Japanese in Chinese media scarcely needs official prompting; Chinese suffering under Japan's cruel occupation is well remembered. Japan is a useful whipping boy to distract attention from the party's inadequacies. China's leaders have legitimate security concerns and a right to seek a larger international role for their nation but, obsessed with their own narrative of victimhood, they do not see that they themselves are becoming Asia's bullies."

One is that of Giles Martin, son of Sir George Martin, producer of the Beatles. Last year, in order to remix the Fab Four\u2019s 1966 album \u201cRevolver\u201d, he used  AI  to learn the sound of each band member\u2019s instruments (eg, John Lennon\u2019s guitar) from a mono master tape so that he could separate them and reverse engineer them into stereo. The result is glorious. The other approach is not bad either. It is the response of Nick Cave, a moody Australian singer-songwriter, when reviewing lyrics written in his style by  Chat  GPT  , an  AI  tool developed by a startup called Open  AI  . \u201cThis song sucks,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWriting a good song is not mimicry, or replication, or pastiche, it is the opposite. It is an act of self-murder that destroys all one has strived to produce in the past.\u201d\nMr Cave is unlikely to be impressed by the latest version of the algorithm behind Chat  GPT  , dubbed  GPT  -4, which Open  AI  unveiled on March 14th. Mr Martin may find it useful. Michael Nash, chief digital officer at Universal Music Group, the world\u2019s biggest label, cites their examples as evidence of both excitement and fear about the  AI  behind content-creating apps like Chat  GPT  (for text) or Stable Diffusion (for images). It could help the creative process. It could also destroy or usurp it. Yet for recorded music at large, the coming of the bots brings to mind a seismic event in its history: the rapid rise and fall of Napster, a platform for sharing mainly pirated songs at the turn of the millennium. Napster was ultimately brought down by copyright law. For aggressive bot providers accused of riding roughshod over intellectual property (  IP  ), Mr Nash has a simple message that sounds, from a music-industry veteran of the Napster era, like a threat. \u201cDon\u2019t deploy in the market and beg for forgiveness. That\u2019s the Napster approach.\u201d",

It is the response of Nick Cave, a moody Australian singer-songwriter, when reviewing lyrics written in his style by <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/business/2022/12/08/how-good-is-chatgpt\"> Chat <small> GPT </small></a> , an <small> AI </small> tool developed by a startup called Open <small> AI </small> . \u201cThis song sucks,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWriting a good song is not mimicry, or replication, or pastiche, it is the opposite. It is an act of self-murder that destroys all one has strived to produce in the past.\u201d </p><p> Mr Cave is unlikely to be impressed by the latest version of the algorithm behind Chat <small> GPT </small> , dubbed <small> GPT </small> -4, which Open <small> AI </small> unveiled on March 14th. Mr Martin may find it useful. Michael Nash, chief digital officer at Universal Music Group, the world\u2019s biggest label, cites their examples as evidence of both excitement and fear about the <small> AI </small> behind content-creating apps like Chat <small> GPT </small> (for text) or Stable Diffusion (for images). It could help the creative process. It could also destroy or usurp it. Yet for recorded music at large, the coming of the bots brings to mind a seismic event in its history: the rapid rise and fall of Napster, a platform for sharing mainly pirated songs at the turn of the millennium. Napster was ultimately brought down by copyright law. For aggressive bot providers accused of riding roughshod over intellectual property ( <small> IP </small> ), Mr Nash has a simple message that sounds, from a music-industry veteran of the Napster era, like a threat. \u201cDon\u2019t deploy in the market and beg for forgiveness. That\u2019s the Napster approach.\u201d </p>",

                    "relevant content": "A  \"  FREE AND  open Indo-Pacific\", intended to encompass both the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, is the hottest geopolitical slogan. When strategists talk about the Indo-Pacific, however, they often mean just the Pacific, and then only the far-western part, around the South China Sea and the East China Sea. It is there that a struggle for primacy is at its fiercest between America, dominant since the second world war, and a resurgent China. Yet the Indian Ocean, relatively neglected until recently, is now having a moment.\nThe economic dynamism of its rim and great importance of the ocean as a hub for trade in goods and energy have long been recognised. Now its strategic significance is catching up. No single power holds sway in this ocean, and perhaps never will. Yet China is making inroads into its waters and other navies also jostle there for influence. A new oceanic era shaped by great-power rivalry has begun. Smaller Indian Ocean countries wonder whether they will be victims of it, or beneficiaries."

The port, primarily backed by a Chinese state-backed shipping and logistics company, Cosco Shipping, aims to upend maritime traffic along the Pacific coast of South America, potentially displacing traffic from Chile, Ecuador, and Colombia. The project has the potential to significantly impact maritime activities and trade in the region, presenting emerging maritime risks and technological developments. The article specifically mentions the intention to pull South American countries towards Peru as a focal point for trade to Asia and the development of infrastructure to facilitate quicker access to Asian markets for countries like Brazil. Additionally, it highlights the potential concerns regarding increased Chinese influence on Peru's infrastructure, as well as the government's efforts to ensure compliance with safety and environmental regulations.

But, today, the beachfront is a sprawling construction site, with cranes shifting pillars as dumper trucks rumble around below.\nThe town is about to become host to one of the largest deepwater ports in Latin America. Construction and operation will be carried out entirely by private companies \u2014 something officials say could be a model for other infrastructure works in Peru.\nThe project is so huge it has the potential to upend maritime traffic all along the Pacific coast of South America, displacing it from Chile, Ecuador and Colombia. In its initial phase, the port is expected to handle 1mn containers and 6mn tonnes of loose cargo a year.\nCosco Shipping  , a Chinese state-backed shipping and logistics company, has a 60 per cent stake in the port, with the remainder in the hands of Volcan, a Peruvian mining company. Of the $3.6bn cost of construction, $1.3bn has already been invested in the initial phase, according to Cosco.\n\u201cThe intention of the port is to pull South American countries towards Peru as a focal point [for trade to Asia], taking advantage of our strategic location,\u201d says Gonz\u00e1lo R\u00edos Polastri, deputy general manager of Cosco Shipping Ports Chancay Peru and a former admiral. \u201cIt will be an engine for development across several industries.\u201d\nThe port will sit on a 280-hectare site. The wave breakers alone used enough concrete to construct 20 buildings of 10 storeys and will protect 1.5km of dock space, capable of berthing some of the world\u2019s largest cargo ships.\nThe intention is to pull South American countries towards Peru as a focal point [for trade to Asia]\nGonz\u00e1lo R\u00edos Polastri, Cosco Shipping A 1.8km tunnel bored beneath Chancay \u2014 at some points 900m deep \u2014 will connect the pier to a logistics centre and the pan-American highway without disrupting traffic in the town.\nCargo will be able to reach China from Peru in 10 days, rather than 45 at present. And Brazil is also expected to be a beneficiary of the port, which will provide quicker access to Asian markets for the country\u2019s exports. Brazil and Peru are connected by the Southern Interoceanic Highway, which passes through the Brazilian agricultural hubs of Acre and Rond\u00f4nia.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole part of Brazil that looks much more to the Pacific than to the Atlantic,\u201d says R\u00edos Polastri. \u201cChancay has many advantages within Peru, and one is that it is the closest port to Brazil. That\u2019s another incentive for trade.\u201d\nThe inauguration of the megaport is planned for late next year, when Chinese president Xi Jinping will attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit, which Peru is hosting. Cosco says the port will eventually expand. \u201cThe master plan is to have 15 piers, though there\u2019s no timeline as we need to see how the port operates in the first few years,\u201d R\u00edos Polastri explains.\nBut, despite the commercial advantages that officials say the port will bring for Peru, some observers \u2014 including US officials \u2014 have expressed concern that it could increase Chinese influence on the country\u2019s infrastructure.\nMario de las Casas, Cosco Shipping Ports Chancay Peru\u2019s public affairs manager, says Peruvian law forbids the use of the port for military purposes without prior approval from the executive branch or Congress. \u201cWithout this preapproval, any such entry would be tantamount to an invasion independently of the ownership of the terminal,\u201d he notes.\nSome local people have criticised the disruption caused by construction, too, though voters in January overwhelmingly elected a mayor who is openly in favour of the development. \u201cI think that\u2019s a good barometer of where the local population is in terms of acceptance of the port,\u201d R\u00edos Polastri suggests.\nThe Peruvian government says the port will boost the local economy, and local developers are hopeful. Along the road into Chancay, billboards advertise yet-to-be-built property developments for sale. \u201cIn the area, there are six fishmeal factories and a fleet of around 70 industrial fishing vessels that are the largest source of work in Chancay,\u201d says Ra\u00fal P\u00e9rez-Reyes, Peru\u2019s transport minister. \u201cThe project allows the possibility of direct shipment abroad.\u201d\nP\u00e9rez-Reyes adds that, while the port will be operated by private companies, the government will monitor their compliance with safety and environmental regulations. Police and customs offices will be built at the site.\n\u201cThe government views the development of ports at the national level in a comprehensive manner, with an effort to provide road or rail access, as well as the logistics infrastructure,\u201d the minister says. \u201cThese types of investments allow ports to operate more efficiently.\u201d\nCongress is considering a bill that would allow for cabotage \u2014 for cargo to move between Peruvian ports before coming on land \u2014 to reduce traffic around the port.\nR\u00edos Polastri says Chancay could pave the way for similar private infrastructure projects in Peru, easing progress by bypassing friction between the public and private sectors. The country\u2019s decentralised constitution mandates that provincial infrastructure projects be contracted and administered by local government.",

It also mentions the claims by Russia, Canada, and Denmark over the Lomonosov ridge, which is believed to be rich in minerals. This aligns with the user's query about the economic and geopolitical implications of Arctic shipping routes.\n",
                    "relevant content": "THE GEOPOLITICS OF the new Arctic entered the mainstream on August 2nd 2007. Descending by  Mir  submersible to a depth of over 4km, a Russian-led expedition planted a titanium Russian flag beneath the North Pole (pictured). The news shocked the world.\nThe Lomonosov ridge under the pole, which is probably rich in minerals, is claimed by Russia, Canada and Denmark. The Russians, it was assumed, were asserting their claim, perhaps even launching a scramble for Arctic resources. One of their leaders, Artur Chilingarov, Russia's leading polar explorer and a Putin loyalist, fanned the flames. \"The Arctic has always been Russian,\" he declared. Yet the expedition turned out to have been somewhat international, initiated by an Australian entrepreneur and a retired American submarine captain, and paid for by a Swedish pharmaceuticals tycoon."

It would include western nations agreeing to formally recognise a Palestinian state, or supporting the Palestinians being granted full membership of the UN.\n\u201cThe real issue is you need hope for Palestinians, it can\u2019t just be economic benefits or removal of symbols of occupation,\u201d the senior official said.\nThe initiative comes as Israel faces mounting international pressure to end its offensive in Gaza, with the US stepping up diplomatic efforts towards a longer term resolution to the conflict and to prevent a broader regional conflagration.\n\nISRAEL\u2019S INCURSION IN GAZA: OCTOBER 2023 TO PRESENT\nIsrael\u2019s defence forces launched air and land offensives in Gaza after Hamas\u2019s brutal October 7 attack in southern Israel.\nHamas killed more than 1,200 people and seized hostages, according to Israeli officials. The IDF\u2019s response has killed more than 24,000 people in Gaza, according to Palestinian officials.\nA temporary truce between the two sides in November allowed for the release of about 105 Israeli women and children as well as foreigners held hostage. This was in exchange for about 240 Palestinian women and children freed from Israeli jails.\nIsrael\u2019s military has carried out one of the largest bombing campaigns in history on the small, blockaded enclave. Satellite data shows the toll the war has taken on Gaza\u2019s infrastructure and homes, with much of the Palestinian enclave\u2019s  two biggest cities in ruins  , including  entire neighbourhoods destroyed  .\nThe IDF\u2019s Arabic spokesperson has  posted maps  on social media platform X indicating areas people should flee from and telling Gaza residents to \u201ckeep following the map carefully\u201d. But civilians have struggled to follow the updates due to limited access to electricity and internet connections.\nIsrael\u2019s military has been tight-lipped about how many troops it has committed to the incursion \u2014 its biggest operation in years. But satellite imagery and tracking data show a significant incursion.\nData tracking the movement of Israeli forces between October 31 and December 31 shows them tightening their hold on Gaza City, surrounding al-Shifa hospital and taking territory in Khan Younis.\nSatellite imagery published from October 31 shows that after  breaching the barrier wall  in at least six places, Israel\u2019s columns cut through Gaza\u2019s sparsely populated farmland to the south of the border, before moving deeper into the strip towards more populated areas.\nAid agencies have warned about the dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza, including a lack of water, medicine and food. Israel has allowed some humanitarian aid into the strip through the Rafah crossing with Egypt, but the UN\u2019s World Food Programme has said people are still at risk of famine.\nThere is also insufficient fuel to keep hospitals and communications networks running after Gaza\u2019s sole power plant went offline on October 11 due to a lack of fuel, with the outage captured by night-time satellite imagery.\n\nHAMAS\u2019S ATTACK ON ISRAEL: OCTOBER 7 2023\nAs much of Israel slept, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented, multipronged dawn assault on the country from the Gaza Strip. The Middle East\u2019s most powerful security force was caught off guard.\nLaunched on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, the assault began in the early hours with thousands of rockets fired at Israeli towns and cities. The barrage set off warning sirens across the south and centre of the country, sending citizens fleeing to air-raid shelters.\nIsrael\u2019s military said Gaza-based militants launched more than 4,500 rockets over that weekend. Many were intercepted by Israel\u2019s Iron Dome defence system, but satellite imagery showed fires and plumes of black smoke rising from some locations that had been hit.\nHundreds of Hamas fighters simultaneously attacked by land, air and sea, repeatedly breaching the fortified barrier between Gaza and Israel.\nImages and videos showed motorbikes carrying armed militants riding through a hole in a wire fence along the border and a bulldozer destroying part of the barrier. Bombs, rockets and drones could also be seen blowing up the fence as well as defensive positions.\nMilitants used motorised paragliders to attack the Supernova music festival, not far from the Gaza border, flying in and turning the two-day rave into the site of a massacre.\nGunmen chased young Israelis across the desert, shooting and snatching people to take back to Gaza as hostages. The Israeli military failed to respond for hours, apparently caught by surprise by the attack. Hundreds of bodies have been recovered from the site.\nAfter breaching the Gaza fence, armed Hamas fighters began targeting Israeli communities at several locations, going door-to-door and taking hostages.\nImages and video show people lying dead in the streets after execution-style killings and residents including women, children and the elderly being taken away.\nThe Hamas militants also attacked Israeli military sites.\nMore than 1,200 Israeli civilians and troops were killed, the IDF said \u2014 making it the deadliest attack on the country since its foundation.\nThe complexity of the assault by Hamas was unlike anything Israel has witnessed in decades. It raised serious questions about the security service\u2019s intelligence gathering and the military\u2019s preparedness for an attack.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu imposed a  \u201ccomplete siege\u201d  on Gaza on October 9, calling up a record 300,000 reservists and ordering the strip to be pounded from the air.\nIsrael\u2019s military also ordered the evacuation of 42 communities along its northern border, where Israelis have died in cross-border fire that Israel blamed on Hizbollah or Lebanon-based Palestinian factions \u2014 part of the Iran-backed \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d.\nVisual and Data team:  Janina Conboye  ,  Peter Andringa  ,  Steven Bernard  ,  Chris Campbell  ,  Sam Joiner  ,  Lucy Rodgers  and  Alan Smith",

The IDF's response has killed more than 24,000 people in Gaza, according to Palestinian officials.\nA temporary truce between the two sides in November allowed for the release of about 105 Israeli women and children as well as foreigners held hostage. This was in exchange for about 240 Palestinian women and children freed from Israeli jails.\nIsrael's military has carried out one of the largest bombing campaigns in history on the small, blockaded enclave. Satellite data shows the toll the war has taken on Gaza's infrastructure and homes, with much of the Palestinian enclave's  two biggest cities in ruins  , including  entire neighbourhoods destroyed  .\nThe IDF's Arabic spokesperson has  posted maps  on social media platform X indicating areas people should flee from and telling Gaza residents to \"keep following the map carefully\". But civilians have struggled to follow the updates due to limited access to electricity and internet connections.\nIsrael's military has been tight-lipped about how many troops it has committed to the incursion  its biggest operation in years. But satellite imagery and tracking data show a significant incursion.\nData tracking the movement of Israeli forces between October 31 and December 31 shows them tightening their hold on Gaza City, surrounding al-Shifa hospital and taking territory in Khan Younis.\nSatellite imagery published from October 31 shows that after  breaching the barrier wall  in at least six places, Israel's columns cut through Gaza's sparsely populated farmland to the south of the border, before moving deeper into the strip towards more populated areas.\nAid agencies have warned about the dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza, including a lack of water, medicine and food. Israel has allowed some humanitarian aid into the strip through the Rafah crossing with Egypt, but the UN's World Food Programme has said people are still at risk of famine.\nThere is also insufficient fuel to keep hospitals and communications networks running after Gaza's sole power plant went offline on October 11 due to a lack of fuel, with the outage captured by night-time satellite imagery.\n\nHAMAS'S ATTACK ON ISRAEL: OCTOBER 7 2023\nAs much of Israel slept, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented, multipronged dawn assault on the country from the Gaza Strip. The Middle East's most powerful security force was caught off guard.\nLaunched on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, the assault began in the early hours with thousands of rockets fired at Israeli towns and cities. The barrage set off warning sirens across the south and centre of the country, sending citizens fleeing to air-raid shelters.\nIsrael's military said Gaza-based militants launched more than 4,500 rockets over that weekend. Many were intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome defence system, but satellite imagery showed fires and plumes of black smoke rising from some locations that had been hit.\nHundreds of Hamas fighters simultaneously attacked by land, air and sea, repeatedly breaching the fortified barrier between Gaza and Israel.\nImages and videos showed motorbikes carrying armed militants riding through a hole in a wire fence along the border and a bulldozer destroying part of the barrier. Bombs, rockets and drones could also be seen blowing up the fence as well as defensive positions.\nMilitants used motorised paragliders to attack the Supernova music festival, not far from the Gaza border, flying in and turning the two-day rave into the site of a massacre.\nGunmen chased young Israelis across the desert, shooting and snatching people to take back to Gaza as hostages. The Israeli military failed to respond for hours, apparently caught by surprise by the attack. Hundreds of bodies have been recovered from the site.\nAfter breaching the Gaza fence, armed Hamas fighters began targeting Israeli communities at several locations, going door-to-door and taking hostages.\nImages and video show people lying dead in the streets after execution-style killings and residents including women, children and the elderly being taken away.\nThe Hamas militants also attacked Israeli military sites.\nMore than 1,200 Israeli civilians and troops were killed, the IDF said  making it the deadliest attack on the country since its foundation.\nThe complexity of the assault by Hamas was unlike anything Israel has witnessed in decades. It raised serious questions about the security service's intelligence gathering and the military's preparedness for an attack.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu imposed a  \"complete siege\"  on Gaza on October 9, calling up a record 300,000 reservists and ordering the strip to be pounded from the air.\nIsrael's military also ordered the evacuation of 42 communities along its northern border, where Israelis have died in cross-border fire that Israel blamed on Hizbollah or Lebanon-based Palestinian factions  part of the Iran-backed \"Axis of Resistance\".\nVisual and Data team:  Janina Conboye  ,  Peter Andringa  ,  Steven Bernard  ,  Chris Campbell  ,  Sam Joiner  ,  Lucy Rodgers  and  Alan Smith"

The judges also praised the practical application of simulations by universities to make wider points about the need for a sustainable future.\n\u201cOne of the striking features of the stronger submissions this year was that they featured consortia of schools and colleges of business, collaborating on design and delivery of sustainability programming,\u201d says Andrew Karolyi, dean at  Cornell  business school and one of the judges. He added that the submissions highlighted how European schools have made \u201cstrategic investments in sustainability-oriented cases, courses, and co-curricular activities earlier than others\u201d.\nEric Cornuel, another of the judges and president of the European Foundation for Management Development, a non-profit network association, highlighted the advances made by the continent\u2019s institutions. \u201cThere was a much higher proportion of submissions of exceptional quality in the sample of European schools than in the sample of American schools,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is possible that a rebalancing in the rankings, in favour of European schools over the ultra-dominant American schools, will accelerate.\u201d\nThis year\u2019s submissions tackled some of the commercial world\u2019s biggest challenges, including the promotion of sustainability across all areas of business and innovative ways of addressing the climate crisis. The subjects covered by those shortlisted include climate change mitigation, social entrepreneurship, sustainable transformation, and the link between business leadership and its social impact.\n\nFOCUS ON DOING GOOD\nMadhu Viswanathan, professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, has been teaching for roughly two decades and always tries to place his students in the shoes of the poor. His \u201cBusiness for Good\u201d course, launched in August 2020 for undergraduates, offers an online poverty simulation from the perspective of a 38-year-old woman as she balances money, time, comfort and health for her and her family.\nStudents come up with a business plan to launch a product for low-income customers in local or global markets while still caring about the returns. Viswanathan places a particular emphasis on the relationship between balancing business interests and the environmental and social impact. \u201cI found the intersection of poverty and marketplaces to be neglected,\u201d he says.\nHe also notes that artificial intelligence has entered the classroom, and is not going away. While he wants his students to understand the value of generating their own ideas, he says AI can be a useful tool to aid the design of new business models. \u201cI am a big believer in this technology,\u201d he says.\nThe judges were impressed with the focus on social impact. They said: \u201cWhile this case might be a bit social entrepreneurship heavy, it still represents an impressive breadth and scope of learning and a dynamic approach to the material and its delivery.\u201d\n\nFIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE\nAcademics have been trying for years to use technology in the classroom in a meaningful way, without much success. But  IE Business School  \u2019s use of virtual reality headsets as part of a climate change mitigation exercise caught the attention of the judges. They can see this technology as a tool to enhance learning, although some question whether it is all a \u201cgimmick\u201d.\nThe use of VR in the classroom is certainly no stunt for Emilio Guillot Onta\u00f1on, IE\u2019s instructional designer who runs the immersive programme, which is powered by AI. Guillot likens the use of the technology to the introduction of the calculator in mathematics: \u201cMaths changed from being a hands-on exercise to being more conceptual in understanding what\u2019s behind it.\u201d\nIE\u2019s \u201cEye in the Storm\u201d takes students through an \u201coverwhelming\u201d journey in the middle of a hurricane using VR headsets. As part of the exercise they must answer crucial questions about climate change.\n\u201cWe want to reignite the conversation about climate change, leveraging this technology that is more engaging than anything else that we might have,\u201d Guillot Onta\u00f1on says. \u201cEye in the Storm\u201d is not confined to a single course but is a flexible module used across various programmes, at undergraduate, masters and corporate levels, he adds.\n\nFINANCE WITH PURPOSE\nWith its \u201cpurpose of finance\u201d course, the University of Cambridge\u2019s  Judge Business School  seeks to challenge traditional ways of looking at finance and make the link between sustainability and the world at large. The academics behind the course \u2014 David Pitt-Watson and Ellen Quigley \u2014 want students to leave with a more critical mindset.\nThe course departs from the conventional neoclassical approach to finance, which often treats environmental and social sustainability issues as add-ons. Instead, the Cambridge programme starts by exploring the purpose of the finance industry and scrutinises how well it fulfils this purpose \u00ad\u2014 especially in the context of sustainability challenges such as climate change, say Pitt-Watson and Quigley.\nA pragmatic approach to learning is key, they add. The course addresses real-world issues, such as biodiversity loss, to encourage students to think critically about the impact of financial decisions on the environment.\nAn example of their practical approach is a simulation exercise that exposes students to the risks of asymmetric information. They assume roles of fund managers and clients, discovering first-hand how information disparities can affect financial decisions and market efficiency.\n\u201cA couple of years back, we introduced more explicitly that sustainability must be at the heart of the fulfilment of purpose,\u201d says Pitt-Watson. \u201cThis, for example, involved the introduction of the perspective of \u2018universal ownership\u2019, which suggests the fund manager should consider systemic issues, particularly climate change.\u201d\n\nAN AGENDA FOR CHANGE\nThomas Lagoarde-Segot, a teacher and researcher at  Kedge Business School  in France, was instrumental in launching an ecological macroeconomics course in 2019. That followed years in which he focused on the importance of looking at climate and sustainability issues from a macro perspective, rather than business schools\u2019 usual emphasis on the micro impact on companies and individuals.\nPartly based on a textbook featuring the contributions of 25 academics, the course revisits concepts of finance and monetary policy from a sustainability perspective. This enables a critical examination of economic and financial factors, such as money, growth and markets, in the context of ecological challenges, and helps prevent greenwashing \u2014 a critical need in today\u2019s sustainability-conscious environment, says Lagoarde-Segot.\nEndorsed by notable figures such US academic and author Professor Jeffrey Sachs, the course offers a comprehensive perspective on economics and finance. It equips students with the intellectual tools to understand the complex and interrelated issues of sustainability, economics and finance.\nThe course is divided into two parts. The first one addresses topics such as credit, money and interest rates through the lens of sustainability \u2014 for example, by interpreting money circulation using the laws of thermodynamics. The second part looks at more micro issues, such as crowdfunding and corporate governance.\n\u201cWe wanted to create a sustainable economics and finance curriculum,\u201d says Lagoarde-Segot. \u201cWe had to innovate and provide new content. To do that, we had to rely on the pluralism of the various schools of economics thinking.\u201d\n\nSUSTAINABILITY LEARNING OFF SITE\nStudents at  Vlerick Business School  \u2019s European EMBA escape their classroom and visit real companies to expose themselves to the sustainability challenges of the investment world.\nOn site, students have a couple of hours to work out solutions to a corporate problem and then they present their findings to the firm to get feedback. This set-up is similar to providing free consulting to companies \u2014 the students apply their learning to real-life scenarios and companies gain fresh perspectives on their sustainability challenges.\nAnother highlight of the course, taught by David Veredas, is the use of the  Financial Times\u2019 Climate Game  , a simulation-based learning experience that encourages students to figure out ways to cut emissions to net zero by 2050. \u201cIt is a good exercise for understanding the complexities of decarbonising the hard-to-abate sectors, which paves the way for macro sustainable strategies,\u201d says Veredas.\nStudents also learn about carbon accounting, the EU\u2019s emissions trading system and the voluntary carbon markets. They are taught why it is important for companies to report using carbon accounting and the challenges involved in doing so.\n\u201cA very important part of the sustainability transformation for companies is to decarbonise,\u201d says Veredas. To do so, \u201cmany companies are putting an internal price on carbon\u201d. The embedding of carbon emissions in different projects helps companies decide on more sustainable ventures with longer term benefits, he adds.",

Additionally, it covers the focus on social impact, innovative approaches to finance with purpose, the introduction of sustainability perspectives in economics and finance courses, and the use of simulation-based learning experiences such as the Financial Times' Climate Game to address sustainability challenges in the investment world. Therefore, the article is relevant to the user's query.\n\n",
                    "relevant content": "Business schools keep finding new ways to meet the increasing demands of students  from the use of virtual reality tools on campus to hands-on interaction with companies driving towards sustainability.\nAnd the submissions for this year's Responsible Business Education awards showed a growing emphasis on including sustainability in all aspects of their curricula, a trend most apparent in European institutions. The judges also praised the practical application of simulations by universities to make wider points about the need for a sustainable future.\n\"One of the striking features of the stronger submissions this year was that they featured consortia of schools and colleges of business, collaborating on design and delivery of sustainability programming,\" says Andrew Karolyi, dean at  Cornell  business school and one of the judges. He added that the submissions highlighted how European schools have made \"strategic investments in sustainability-oriented cases, courses, and co-curricular activities earlier than others\".\nEric Cornuel, another of the judges and president of the European Foundation for Management Development, a non-profit network association, highlighted the advances made by the continent's institutions. \"There was a much higher proportion of submissions of exceptional quality in the sample of European schools than in the sample of American schools,\" he says. \"It is possible that a rebalancing in the rankings, in favour of European schools over the ultra-dominant American schools, will accelerate.\"\nThis year's submissions tackled some of the commercial world's biggest challenges, including the promotion of sustainability across all areas of business and innovative ways of addressing the climate crisis. The subjects covered by those shortlisted include climate change mitigation, social entrepreneurship, sustainable transformation, and the link between business leadership and its social impact.\n\nFOCUS ON DOING GOOD\nMadhu Viswanathan, professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, has been teaching for roughly two decades and always tries to place his students in the shoes of the poor. His \"Business for Good\" course, launched in August 2020 for undergraduates, offers an online poverty simulation from the perspective of a 38-year-old woman as she balances money, time, comfort and health for her and her family.\nStudents come up with a business plan to launch a product for low-income customers in local or global markets while still caring about the returns. Viswanathan places a particular emphasis on the relationship between balancing business interests and the environmental and social impact. \"I found the intersection of poverty and marketplaces to be neglected,\" he says.\nHe also notes that artificial intelligence has entered the classroom, and is not going away. While he wants his students to understand the value of generating their own ideas, he says AI can be a useful tool to aid the design of new business models. \"I am a big believer in this technology,\" he says.\nThe judges were impressed with the focus on social impact. They said: \"While this case might be a bit social entrepreneurship heavy, it still represents an impressive breadth and scope of learning and a dynamic approach to the material and its delivery.\"\n\nFIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE\nAcademics have been trying for years to use technology in the classroom in a meaningful way, without much success. But  IE Business School  's use of virtual reality headsets as part of a climate change mitigation exercise caught the attention of the judges. They can see this technology as a tool to enhance learning, although some question whether it is all a \"gimmick\".\nThe use of VR in the classroom is certainly no stunt for Emilio Guillot Ontaon, IE's instructional designer who runs the immersive programme, which is powered by AI. Guillot likens the use of the technology to the introduction of the calculator in mathematics: \"Maths changed from being a hands-on exercise to being more conceptual in understanding what's behind it.\"\nIE's \"Eye in the Storm\" takes students through an \"overwhelming\" journey in the middle of a hurricane using VR headsets. As part of the exercise they must answer crucial questions about climate change.\n\"We want to reignite the conversation about climate change, leveraging this technology that is more engaging than anything else that we might have,\" Guillot Ontaon says. \"Eye in the Storm\" is not confined to a single course but is a flexible module used across various programmes, at undergraduate, masters and corporate levels, he adds.\n\nFINANCE WITH PURPOSE\nWith its \"purpose of finance\" course, the University of Cambridge's  Judge Business School  seeks to challenge traditional ways of looking at finance and make the link between sustainability and the world at large. The academics behind the course  David Pitt-Watson and Ellen Quigley  want students to leave with a more critical mindset.\nThe course departs from the conventional neoclassical approach to finance, which often treats environmental and social sustainability issues as add-ons. Instead, the Cambridge programme starts by exploring the purpose of the finance industry and scrutinises how well it fulfils this purpose  especially in the context of sustainability challenges such as climate change, say Pitt-Watson and Quigley.\nA pragmatic approach to learning is key, they add. The course addresses real-world issues, such as biodiversity loss, to encourage students to think critically about the impact of financial decisions on the environment.\nAn example of their practical approach is a simulation exercise that exposes students to the risks of asymmetric information. They assume roles of fund managers and clients, discovering first-hand how information disparities can affect financial decisions and market efficiency.\n\"A couple of years back, we introduced more explicitly that sustainability must be at the heart of the fulfilment of purpose,\" says Pitt-Watson. \"This, for example, involved the introduction of the perspective of 'universal ownership', which suggests the fund manager should consider systemic issues, particularly climate change.\"\n\nAN AGENDA FOR CHANGE\nThomas Lagoarde-Segot, a teacher and researcher at  Kedge Business School  in France, was instrumental in launching an ecological macroeconomics course in 2019. That followed years in which he focused on the importance of looking at climate and sustainability issues from a macro perspective, rather than business schools' usual emphasis on the micro impact on companies and individuals.\nPartly based on a textbook featuring the contributions of 25 academics, the course revisits concepts of finance and monetary policy from a sustainability perspective. This enables a critical examination of economic and financial factors, such as money, growth and markets, in the context of ecological challenges, and helps prevent greenwashing  a critical need in today's sustainability-conscious environment, says Lagoarde-Segot.\nEndorsed by notable figures such US academic and author Professor Jeffrey Sachs, the course offers a comprehensive perspective on economics and finance.
