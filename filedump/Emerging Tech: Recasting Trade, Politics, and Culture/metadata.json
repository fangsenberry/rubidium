    "action_plan": "Approach: I will analyze the potential impact of emerging technologies like DAOs, generative AI, and edge computing on global trade, political discourse, and cultural integration in the context of the Belt and Road Initiative and the Indian Ocean's strategic importance. To do so, I'll first examine the current state of these technologies and their adoption rates, then elucidate their specific applications within the types of initiatives mentioned. I should also take into account the current geopolitical and economic environment of countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative and the Indian Ocean region. This information will provide the foundations to assess their direct and indirect effects on global trade flows, political relationships, and sociocultural trends across these contexts.\n\nActions:\n[RESEARCH] Investigate the latest advancements and adoption statuses of DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), generative AI, and edge computing.\n[RESEARCH] Explore how these technologies are currently being utilized, with a specific focus on applications that could influence trade, politics, and cultural dynamics.\nIdentify the countries most actively participating in the Belt and Road Initiative and those with strategic stakes in the Indian Ocean region.\n[RESEARCH] Profiling these countries' current technological landscapes to understand their capability to adopt and integrate the aforementioned technologies.\n[RESEARCH] Assess the Belt and Road Initiative's existing and projected infrastructure projects that could potentially be augmented by DAOs, generative AI, and edge computing.\n[RESEARCH] Investigate how the Indian Ocean's strategic importance is currently characterized and could be redefined by technology-driven changes in maritime trade, security, and regional influence.\n[RESEARCH] Analyze historical patterns of global trade, political discourse, and cultural integration to identify baselines for comparison.\nEvaluate the potential economic ramifications of these technologies on global trade patterns, focusing on automation, supply chain efficiency, and data analytics for predictive logistics.\n[RESEARCH] Delve into political strategy literature to predict how the technologies could affect discourse, policy-making, and international alliances, especially within trade agreements and alignments.\n[RESEARCH] Study sociocultural dynamics to infer how enhanced connectivity and data sharing might influence cultural integration, information flows, and public sentiment.\nSynthesize the gathered information to draw intersections between technology, economic forecasts, and sociopolitical implications through analytic scenarios.\n[RESEARCH] Consult subject-matter experts and acquire qualitative data to enrich the scenario analysis with multidisciplinary insights.\nReflect on the resilience and adaptability of the Belt and Road Initiative and Indian Ocean region's strategic frameworks to technological disruptions.\nEstimate timelines and milestone achievements to sketch realistic transformation paths influenced by the emerging technologies.\nDevelop a comprehensive Net Assessment report detailing the interplay between DAOs, generative AI, edge computing, and the strategic initiatives in question, projecting short-term and long-term outcomes.\nWith this structured approach and extensive data collated, I should have a robust, dynamic framework for a comprehensive analysis.",

DAOs are designed to operate without centralized leadership, and the parameters of their decision-making powers and processes are often determined by the smart contracts governing the project in question.\n\nWhen a DAO is formed, founders frequently mint a governance token, which is a type of crypto asset that may entitle the holder to DAO membership and a certain amount of voting power on DAO decisions \u2014 typically the more tokens someone holds, the more votes they have. DAO tokens are typically initially distributed to the project\u2019s management, users, backers, and other stakeholders, but can then be bought and sold on secondary markets like any other cryptocurrency.

Established when the Han Dynasty in China officially opened trade with the West in 130 B.C., the Silk Road routes remained in use until A.D. 1453, when the Ottoman Empire boycotted trade with China and closed them. \n\nRoyal Road\nThe Silk Road may have formally opened up trade between the Far East and Europe during the Han Dynasty, which ruled China from 206 B.C. to A.D. 220 Han Emperor Wu sent imperial envoy Zhang Qian to make contact with cultures in Central Asia in 138 B.C., and his reports from his journeys conveyed valuable information about the people and lands that lay to the West. But the transport of goods and services along these routes dates back even further.\n\nThe Royal Road, which connected Susa (in present-day Iran) more than 1,600 miles west to Sardis (near the Mediterranean Sea in modern Turkey), was established by the Persian ruler Darius I during the Achaemenid Empire\u2014some 300 years before the opening of the Silk Road.\n\nThe Persians also expanded the Royal Road to include smaller routes that connected Mesopotamia to the Indian subcontinent as well as northern Africa via Egypt.\n\n\n\nAnalog said it will harness the capabilities of edge computing to create a smooth and interconnected relationship among individuals, locations and objects, and boost speed while minimising latency.\n\nThe company said it will deliver custom solutions to tackle challenging global issues for business, public sector companies as well as health care and the environment sectors.\n\nThe AI market is projected to reach $305.9 billion this year, according to Statista. It is expected to show an annual growth rate of 15.83 per cent, resulting in a market volume of $738.8 billion by 2030.\n\nEdge computing is an emerging paradigm that refers to a range of networks and devices at or near the user. Edge is about processing data closer to where it\u2019s being generated, enabling processing at greater speeds and volumes, leading to greater action-led results in real time, according to consultancy Accenture.\n\n\u201cIn traditional AI companies, intelligence comes from historical data that is pre-trained and digitally stored \u2026 while in edge computing, intelligence emerges from live, real time sensors\u2019 data. So, this world of AI is very focused on understanding the complexities of real world in real time, understanding people, understanding places and understanding things,\u201d Mr Kipman said.\n\n\u201cWe will be harnessing data coming from millions of sensors to help businesses grow their bottom line while devising solutions that are human-centric in approach.\u201d\n\nAnalog's ability to capture and use data from the real world is the company's unique selling proposition, Mr Kipman said.\n\n\u201cA lot of sensors exist in the world today but there are not a lot of systems or solutions that give you insights from top of those sensors.\n\n\n\nWith digital technology and ubiquitous access to data, can the EAEU be based on a DAO \u2013 Decentralized Autonomous Organization of \u2018like-minded\u2019 investors, traders and buyers?\n\n(6)\tReinforcing land-based global Eurasian trade will be the increasing utility of the Arctic trade routes:\n\n(7)\tThe North Sea Route (NSR)\nThe northwest passage \u2013 short cut asia \u2013 europe\n4th century BC \u2013 indigenous people\nPytheas sails north\n981 Erik the Red\n1490 John Cabbot \u2013 northwest passage\n1610 Henry Hudson\n1778 James Cook\n1843 John Franklin\n1903 Roald Amundsen\n1932 Otto Yulievich\n1935 Russian NSR\n1994 UN Convention Law of the Sea\n2010 Russian nuclear ice breaker\n2013 Chinese domestic ice breaker \n\nA new record for cargo transported via Russia's Northern Sea Route was set in 2023 with existing nuclear icebreakers providing more than 730 vessel support services. Work continues to progress on two more nuclear-powered icebreakers.\n\nThe Northern Sea Route (NSR) runs along the north coast of Russia connecting the European and far eastern ports of Russia over a distance of 5600 kilometres. By 21 December, Rosatom reported that 35 million tonnes had been transported, compared with the previous record of 34.1 million tonnes, which was set in 2021.\n\nVladimir Panov, special representative of the Rosatom State Corporation for Arctic development, noted that in 1987 the record for NSR freight for the Soviet Union was set at 7 tonnes and that 2023's figure was a bounce back from 2022 when there was a 90% drop in transit cargo flow \"due to geopolitical factors\".\n\n\n\nAlexander the Great, ruler of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedonia, expanded his dominion into Persia via the Royal Road. Parts of the thoroughfare were ultimately incorporated into the Silk Road.\n\n(3)\tBy the opening of the 16th Century, Portuguese Vasco da Gama had arrived in India, and what followed was the \u2018West\u2019 discovery and ability to launch maritime trade routes.  From  1602-1795 Dutch East India Company VOC (Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie) as an Amsterdam-based joint-stock company established profitable means of trade with the \u2018East.\u2019   Within 100 years the \u2018West\u2019 set \u2018international laws\u2019 of trade and accountability and expected the \u2018East\u2019 to abide.\n\n(4)\tIn 1904, Halford John Mackinder wrote of a \u2018heartland theory\u2019 \u2013 from the Volga to the Yangtze and a land-based apprach to trade with the \u2018East\u2019 \u2013 from the Arctic to Himalayas.   \n\nHe viewed the world of trade as:  (1) World islands; (2) Offshort islands, and outlying islands.   It reinforced the \u2018great game\u2019 of \u2018statecraft\u2019 and domination of \u2018law.\u2019\n\n(5)\tWhat is termed as the \u2018Eurasian Economic Union\u2019 \u2013 EAEU \u2013 is based on Mackinder\u2019s \u2018heartland theory\u2019 in an era when infrastructure and technology can support and possibly surpase the levels of maritime trade.\n\n Jais is a significant contribution to the international open-source community.

If the objective is to ignite a major, wider conflict, the cost vs result ratio to achieve it in that area is very favourable.\n\n\n\nJohn, you had your hand up.  Please comment.\n\nMr. John Alton\n\nYes. Can Peter put the map that he referenced in the Signal chat, not just the zoom chat? \n\nPeter\n\nI will do it both. I'll put it in the zoom chat now, and I'll put it in the signal chat immediately. Okay, thanks.\n\nPhil\n\nThank you.\n\nDevinda, South Asia is in between the choke points.  Significant elections are coming up throughout South Asia in the next several months. If you could give some thoughts about what you're hearing.\n\n\nAmbassador Devinda Subasinghe\n\nThank you, Phil. \n\nI think the immediate impact of the disruption of shipping lanes in the Red Sea is still to be determined. But given the high dependence on imported energy in the region, any of these disruptions will have an impact on price pressure on foreign exchange reserves, as well as domestic implications on pricing that have a social fallout. \n\nAs we look ahead to 2024 and the election cycle, there'll be elections in Bangladesh, in India, Sri Lanka. Maldives just had a presidential election, so they're done for the next term. And Pakistan will stumble its way into an election as well. So there'll be a great deal of focus on the stress points externally-generated on the economic outlook in each of these countries. \n\nThere's no clear view as to what the solutions are, but clearly the Israel-Hamas conflict is being viewed very differently in the region than most parts of the world.\n\n \n\nSo going back to digital media.  It's a pretty interesting time that we are living, given that four or five elections are at the same time. Given the division in South Asia, the racism and the religious wars always had been very nasty operative in politics with all character assassinations, and so on and so forth. It's nothing about policies. It's all about emotions. And emotions can be manipulated by digital media very easily. So that's worthwhile actually looking at as a group for all of us. \n\nThank you so much.\nPhil\n\nThank you, Saliya very much. \n\nAl Wilhelm, it was great to see you this week for an update.  One of the key points of our discussion this week was ambiguity.  Al, I thought you might want to make a few comments based on what we're talking about and events going on.  Can we manage ambiguity?\n\nDr. Al Wilhelm\n\nWell, I'm not sure I have any cogent remarks to make about ambiguity. I do know that certainly there is an argument in the current Foreign Policy magazine that ambiguity and the relationship between the United States, China, and Taiwan is critical, and that's what the Taiwan Relations Act was based upon. But as we were talking the other day, I think that cat's out of the bag and the ability to walk it backwards is going to be pretty difficult, even if the United States were to, and this current administration, were to formally get back to a Taiwan Relations Act stand.\n\n India has taken a strong stand because of its shared views on counterterrorism vis a vis Israel, but the rest of the country's, the public opinion is significantly negative with regard to the continuing campaign by Israel, and that is playing into the hands of the, I wouldn't say radicalization, but the radical elements of Muslim populations throughout the region. And it will be worth monitoring as to where that might break, if it does, adding to the uncertainty will be the election. Thank you.\n\nPhil\n\nThank you very much, Devinda. \n\nJerry, would you like to make some comments on the overall, what you're saying, the projection of logistics and the disruptions going on, or any other comments you have?\n\nMr. Jerry Hultin\n\nI'm feeling pretty much in a listening mode today. \n\nI've said earlier that I think a lot of these forces are going along with Jaymie and Peter and others are unsettling and we don't have easy answers on them and I think the U.S. election is not helping that and so I think we're facing a tough time. We need to come up with better solutions and new ways to go. \n\nI was intrigued with the article that began to discuss how nations since they're unable to settle some of these major issues we're beginning to see a more planet-wide sensibility. COP 28 has that kind of quality of it doesn't really decide like nations decide, but it does lead towards awareness and consciousness and behavior change. And that could be one way we need to go which is just people behave in new ways and try to minimize the way nations decide.\n\n So there are solutions. \n\nThe other big solution of course would be energy independence. A good bit of what's moving is energy. The second is production of goods and both of those could be things that countries began to take more seriously. So their dependency on these choke points goes down and their self reliance increases.\n\n\nPhil\n\nAlex, I'm going to give a prelude here but if you could add a comment please.   \n\nWhen I was in China last month, an entrepreneur briefed me that starting in January the Chinese are going to start licensing private companies to do drone-delivery of containers. Four matched drones that can lift a full container and deliver it. So I think we need to brace for a whole new era in the logistics area.  Recently Alex met this gentleman as well.  So Alex, I thought you might want to add some comments in the context of what we're discussing today.\n\nAlex\n\nSure. I think what Phil mentioned is not exactly what you're going to acquire a drone. Actually our impression is typically a quadcopter or a small little plane with small payload. But what you're looking at is almost like an unmanned aerial vehicle. So they will be able to fly and carry a cargo of about close to 20 tons and able to take off and land on a small airstrips. The few of them I saw on the document is actually propeller plane and non jet. So they will be using the runway of less than 2 km type. And they are flying all below 3000 meters.\n\n Boundaries and conflict are sort of defining. \n\nI'm going to leave it at that. I think it's pretty jumbled time and too hard to make strong conclusions.\n\nPhil\n\nThank you. \n\nJaymie, you wanted to add a comment?\n\nJaymie\n\nYes. So my comment actually goes back to - I'm listening to all this, and I'm reading about what's happening in the Red Sea and the Straits and everything else.  One of the things that we have to be aware of is geography because why is it that the Straits and the Red Sea are so important? It's because it makes it easier and faster to get goods from one place to the other and people make money. There is an alternative to the Straits and the Red Sea, and that's going around Africa takes a lot more time. It costs more money but ultimately that's a solution and so we need to think about what we're doing as a world by trying to keep these things open. And I understand freedom of navigation and things of that nature, but the strategic impact of shutting down the Middle East to traffic is not as important as people think in my view.\n\nPhil\n\nJerry you wanted to add something?\n\nJerry\n\nFollowing up on Jaymie's comment, I would agree geography. \n\nIf you look at the Straits of Malacca for instance they're not really a choke point. You can navigate your way through the Indonesian archipelago and things like that and it adds some additional costs but not a lot.\n\n That means it is quite different from how COP 28 is functioning right now, whereby all the countries would have to voice their opinions and concerns before making a conservative effort to vote and decide on things. \n\nBut if there was a stalemate, what would happen was that I would say the key countries in this new formation, this new Congress of Parties for this maritime agreement, could come together, and with consensus of two thirds of the countries, it could decide on international binding law, which came as quite surprise in the text of the agreement itself. \n\nSo we're studying this a bit further to really see what would the impact be given that I would say the boundaries of this agreement now extends past the national jurisdictions, and is really into the open seas. So that would definitely impact things like shipping. That's definitely one. But also undersea, open ocean mining and ocean exploration. So those are some of the things that we are studying, and we'll probably do a fuller report when that happens. \n\nSo coming back to COP 28, a lot of my colleagues have also been commenting and saying that it is really a COP with no outcome. We were a bit surprised that the global stock tech, which was supposed to nail down some of the management reporting and verification frameworks, were not even discussed. It was just a text and a comment that we would look into it. So that was something which came as a bit of a surprise to us because we were quite certain that the global stock take would begin this year, I'll say next year.\n\n So I think the US won't have to worry about the Japanese taking over Allentown that's it.\n\nBack to you.\n\nPhil\n\nThank you Naoto.\n\nSaliya, as somebody that works with the media environment and the digital age, if you could give some thoughts, everything you've heard today, how do you get the right narrative out to people, especially in an election year like you're facing?\n\nMr. Saliya Weerakoon\n\nYes.  As Devinda said, we are facing elections in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan and even in Bhutan. So the digital communications is key.\n\nI just returned from India where I spoke in a conference about the power of the Indian ocean. That's a paper that I presented, and I was talking to some of the senior people in India, especially after the last three assembly elections. So people are conceding that the Premier Narendra Modi and the BJP government is more likely to be established for the third consecutive time in 2024 April-May elections. \n\nThe key is in South Asia, given especially from 2015 election in Sri Lanka. That's probably the first election won by purely on Facebook was part of it. And now the digital communications, especially in politics, and changing the narrative, it's become increasingly effective, especially with AI and some of the imagery and the video productions, which is much easier than it was before, because it has takes only about $30 seconds to develop a video now using AI, I mean, you only spend about $20 to get a video for the whole month subscription.\n\n And it's like walking with lightened flame into an explosive depot, and it's only a matter of time since a warship, it gets hit and then everything breaks loose. \n\nSo I wonder if the Chinese are not sort of benefiting of business.  As you see, maybe the ground version is not so bad. And I wonder, what are your thoughts about.\n\n\n\nPhil\n\nThanks, Alvaro. \n\nJaymie, do you want to make a comment at this point?\n\nMr. Jaymie Durnan\n\nThanks. I'm listening to all this, and it's important to understand that I'm concerned about what Sam Huntington and others wrote years ago about the clash of civilizations, and that we are seeing more and more of these clashes occurring. And what's changed now is technology. And the fact that, as I put in the chat that the counter-UAS issue has become the problem that the Americans faced with IEDs against what was supposedly a relatively unsophisticated army and an unsophisticated country. And it cost billions of dollars and a lot of lives to get to the point where we can almost figure out how to counter IEDs. \n\nWhat's happening, and I think Admiral Miller, Admiral Koda, probably understand this better than I do, but what's happening with the Hoothis in a very narrow space, geographic space.\n\nOkay. We have the assets, the Japanese have the assets to shoot down these drones that are being fired and missiles that are being fired.\n\n",
        "6 Jan 2024.txt": " And in the current time, we can foresee that AI will be enhancing the influence, enhancing the digital influence. So whoever know how to use it, whoever can use it will effectively infect the people. I use the term infect because it will be able to make the person who shaping him to who he is supposed to be by the AI, by the person controlling behind. So it is not the AI that is a problem, it's actually the so called the dark hand behind that use it. I think that is one key things that I think we have to be fully aware today. Our discussion seems to be going all over the place. But I can pretty much summarize into a line. We started off from talking about climate, we're talking about rule changes and how the rulemaking are also changing at the same time. We're talking about, yes, a lot of election, but ultimately that is involved with the sovereignty of the country and how to distribute the resources, where the resources going to be. But ultimately there is also going to be a very chaotic times. And in fact, we are not even sure of how copyright and IP can be clearly defined right now because it's always building on top of another OIP. So from the technology aspect as well as investment aspect, it can be quite chaotic for this year. Now bringing the chinese farmer calendar. Yes, it's going to be chaotic. So I think all the more I think we have to stick to having a very open discussions and in order for us to understand what is going on and at least help us to steer through this very, very chaotic time.\n\n Right. Having elections in an increasingly complex landscape, with AI really driving narratives, we're seeing that very strong. And circling back to what I comment about the events that will take place this coming week in Brazil. We are seeing a lot of. There are lots of conversations about regulating AI in the political discourse here in Brazil. I'm very skeptical about that and very skeptical about the capacity of people in leadership, in different branches of the government to address those properly. So just to close the loop and talk and mention that, I'll comment about Mexico. Mexico will have its first ever presidential female president being elected. Whoever wins, she'll be a woman, right. Differently from other countries in the region. Mexico has a long term strategy, and that is mostly an emergent and implicit strategy, that is to integrate with Mexico and Canada. Most of the region does not have a strategy and faces this complex landscape. Mexico has a strategy that's mostly implicit. And we've been seeing in recent decades investment, including in manufacturing, being expanded in Mexico to supply the markets of Canada and uS. Right. Interesting fact, data coming out last week was showing that in spite of those investments, in spite of the economic opportunities presented by integration, productivity in Mexico has been stagnant. And that again circles back to the issue that systems dixons on Main street are the many answers. And it seems that the institutions that we have in place are not capable of providing those answers at this point.\n\n So how will international shipping and global logistics be impacted by the new ecs? And of course the opening of the Arctic Europe due to global warming? So these are really some of the questions which we will study a bit further. Thank you so much for the time to share this, and I hope that it has given some food for thought on how really some of these international treaties are shaping our world that we live in. So, Alex, I will stop the sharing and I'll pass the time back to you.\n\nSpeaker B:\nThank you. Thanks again. I think it's a very, what's it called? Comprehensive sharing. Moving from the subject on climate change and how the lawmaking, the rulemaking actually changed by the IO international organization, it is no longer kind of shift towards a consensus voting versus that consensus negotiation. Although we see that the consensus negotiation sometimes doesn't work, especially in the situation of Europe and many, many other countries. This voting seems to be more efficient, but on the other hand is that it is also not able to look after everybody's interests. So it again become a majority win kind of situation. I'm not too sure whether it is something that is favorable, but I think the most important is actually the ECS economic zone. That change. It would definitely start creating a lot of conflicts. I would like to pose questions to Japan. Maybe Nishi san can help to maybe share a little bit, is that Japan being an island and the sea base, sea lane, sea route and sea resources especially are all very important to Japan, especially the supply that going to Asia and coming down.\n\n I think I very much agree with you on the New York Times lawsuit is probably one of the very pivotal one, because as far as intellectual property is concerned, it is very difficult to separate. So imagine an instructor who learned from everybody else, and now he put his knowledge on the GPT as a GPT builder and offer it as AI consultant, and then who really owned the IP? I think that's a major big questions, and nobody can really separate that part as yet. So we will have to look at the world. So eventually understand. And what you mentioned about CGI, also very true. Speaking to a few of the movie makers, they are basically saying that if now they were to make Star wars, they will use a lot less people right now with the AI able to basically generate a lot of stuff down there. Jerry, you made some comments.\n\nSpeaker A:\nSorry to interrupt.\n\nSpeaker G:\nI'm going to put the link for the film festival in the.\n\nSpeaker B:\nAh, that's good. Thanks. Yeah. Jerry, you make a comment just now regarding the New York time. Maybe you want to elaborate a little bit more. Thanks.\n\nSpeaker H:\nWell, in both cases, the issue of sovereignty, the beginning of institutions that set global rules. I think if you look back over history, if you go from villages, which used to be the boundary of sovereignty, they were the ones that set the rules, told people how to behave within a village.\n\n Use of ocean and how we are going to develop the seabase. These are going to be very important for gaining resources in the 21st century. And therefore, anchor is going to be important, not only the surface of the sea, but also how to use the seabed and the bottom and how we are going to get materials from there. There will be a lot of controversy and a lot of debate how we are going to develop the rules and regulations overseas. That is the japanese understanding. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker B:\nThank you. I think what you highlight is very important is that UNCLOS is definitely very important for us as a base for us to be able to move, especially the resources. Without that, exploitation of all the resources is going to be major, major chaos. Talking about resources, I would like to just shift the time over to roboto from the South America. Then, in your context, how do you view this change? South America, pretty much, outside of all the quarrel and fight. Right? So how would South America view all these changes, especially the rule changes.\n\nSpeaker C:\nThank you, Alex. Hi, everybody. Happy new year. I think that maybe I'm not qualified to talk about that, Alex. Not fully informed. That's my answer to your question. I need to reflect a bit on that. Curiously, the new president of Argentina is in Antarctica today talking plastics. So Argentina is initiating a new initiative with international atomic agency and really trying to understand how microplastics are affecting Antarctica.\n\n And then it also begets the question, how are these chains with the BBNJ where science is being used? The whole guise of it is that the whole premise of the BBNJ is really about marine and biological diversity and conservation. Right? So they want to restrict activities with the BBNJ and making sure that if any activities happen, there will need to be environmental impact assessments, there need to be burying protected areas and stuff like this, sustainable fishing and all these different kind of rules. Right. But it then begins also a question. How will these be policed enforced? If it's literally no man's land, it belongs to the high seas, how will these really change with the PB J? And more importantly, now they're starting to see that an example or use case, right. Whereby the US as unit also said that there are areas outside that belongs to them. So what kind of repercussions will this create? This is my last slide. We are kind of still exploring some of these questions. And definitely we like to also seek views from around the table. Right. This group on geopolitical issues. Really, how are governments around the world? Because right now it touches the marina trench, eats into some of the territory claims of Japan. Guam was one of it that was mentioned, I think. And also Canada, which has the illusion islands, and Russia. Right. Because of the bearing street. So how will governments really react to this? I'm not sure what the court is as well.\n\n And the recording allow us to be able to now trigger a further thinking about a subject. For example, the Jujian mentioned about the change of rule and what are the new things that could happen, and the system will be able to trigger us to do that. Now, with the AI system ability to assess the Internet, you'll be able to assess a lot more information and start compiling it. And that enable them to apply the net assessment principle for us to generate reports, report that net assessment report that's based on the question that we ask, for example, that Zhujian just asked a few NQR, not quite right. And those questions will eventually toss into the report, and report will attempt to answer and provide some, probably a thesis and antithesis, eventually narrowed down to a proper outcome. So I would say that the saloon session right now has developed into something that's very useful. So useful that I think we are able to glance more insight, as I think Louis previously has also emphasized that quite a few bit of things that we share ahead of time, and those are very good trigger for us to understand how the world situation developed, that provide us with a very comprehensive view of the world and able to provide guidance to the leaders as well as business leader to do something that they may make some of strategic decisions. Yeah, so basically this is what the solutions have, that kind of capability. Phil.\n\nSpeaker D:\nOkay, well, thank you and sorry to interrupt everybody.\n\n As our interests expand, as our technology expands, we've expanded the definition of where sovereignty is. We go through city states, we go up 16 hundreds. We get to nations. Nations was a fairly good definition of geographic reach. It worked for a while, and then we began to see that some things we really care about, quality of the air, quality of the oceans, avoiding pandemics. Nation states aren't that good at solving. They're helpful, just like cities are helpful. But we don't give cities sovereignty anymore, except in cases like, maybe we call Singapore a city state. It's an evolution salon type. Someone's got their mic on.\n\nSpeaker B:\nLet me just.\n\nSpeaker D:\nI'm sorry to bother everybody. This is Phil.\n\nSpeaker A:\nHi, Phil.\n\nSpeaker D:\nAnd I'm in Beijing, and we just want to do a quick hello, obviously, Mr. Gao, but.\n\nSpeaker B:\nHello.\n\nSpeaker D:\nAlex, you remember Professor Bai Chungan.\n\nSpeaker B:\nYes, hi.\n\nSpeaker D:\nAnd Victoria, who you've met.\n\nSpeaker B:\nYes, we have.\n\nSpeaker D:\nJijian and Luna.\n\nSpeaker B:\nHello, everybody from Beijing.\n\nSpeaker D:\nBut, Alex, this is a good time for everybody to hear. Alex, if you could just. Victoria will be in contact with you, but if you could just give some thoughts on this salon that we're having now and the net assessment process.\n\n And people are starting to remember who they are. They're not this fantasy. They're not the global oneness tv kind of beings that we've been led to believe largely through commercialism. We are these individuals. We have deep internal needs that have not been met under the television global paradigm. And so as a result, there will be a rise in confusion, a rise in conflict, and we see it manifested. So this group's position is that the political that we see, the political conflicts that we see are actually figure they are surface effects and there's a deeper ground struggle that's going on that's being driven by the technology and the technology's effect on human beings and in particular communication. So that's the basis of the comments that I've made. Jason is part of this. So do you have anything to add, Jason? Did I miss anything here?\n\nSpeaker C:\nNo. I appreciate credit for the electric north and the print south, but that comes from McLuhan. That's the Gutenberg galaxy. But thank you.\n\nSpeaker B:\nYeah, thank you, John. Let me just do a quick summary of what have they said. I think what, John, you bring out is very important, thanks to Jason. One of the things that I'm seeing right now is because of the election year, with so many elections going on, the people are all seeking information in order for them to make a choice. Now, the key things is that people are now looking digitally for information.\n\n",
        "16 Jan .txt": "  I mean, this notion of AI and information and what it's doing, and we're scared of it. We'd rather spend more time thinking about how we're going to regulate AI than what we're going to do about dealing with drone strikes at will by anybody who can spend $400 to buy a drone. \n\nWe have to start asking ourselves questions about the future of democracy. I mean, Jim Schlesinger, former Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Energy, once said that \u2018democracy is incredibly messy, but eventually, we get things right.\u2019 Well, I'm not quite sure we have time to get things right anymore. And so, again, it's a very unsettled world. And as I've talked about before, I think we need to start thinking, we need to pay attention to what I call the clash and crash of cultures and civilizations and technologies, because it's all coming apart in one sense, or maybe coming apart.  I'm starting to ask that question. \n\nBut this civilizational cultural, technological crash and clash is going to cause bigger problems. And if we don't solve where we are today quickly, and I'm not quite sure that we can, I think that we're headed for a much darker future. \n\nPhil\n\nThanks Jaymie.\n\nAnd with that, Alvaro.  I saw you put some thoughts in the chat. But if you could share with us, please. \n\nD Alvaro de Orl\u00e9ans-Borb\u00f3n\n\nThanks.\n\n I don't think we're going to get there immediately, and I think it's going to be a wonderful cambrian explosion that's messy and noisy. But I think if anybody's poised to capitalize on that, it's obviously OpenAI right now, at least in terms of kind of western markets. \n\nI would be curious to hear whether the group has identified any other, especially open-source models. I know that a lot of the open-source models coming out of the Middle East, I think the UAE has a really good one called Falcon or Osprey or something like that. \n\nBut otherwise, heading with my boss to Davos this week to talk about what our initiative is going to be, and kind of his initiative that's, broadly speaking, trying to catalyze a coalition of organizations where we bring about an Internet where people have agency over their data, a voice in how digital platforms operate, and access to the economic value they create, regardless of where they are, who they are, what their nationality is, etc. \n\nSo those conversations are going to be moving forward with folks like Nandan Nilekani from India, and people who have expertise in building digital public infrastructure, stacks of that kind. And I think if you can get the infrastructure level correct, and the digital public infrastructure level correct, you can actually have an Internet, coupled with some of these incredible App Stores, burgeoning with AI, that can have that truth and veracity built in if you leverage the right tools and mechanisms.\n\n \n\nI think OpenAI probably recognizes that in the next rush, in the next iteration of whatever the digital landscape is going to look like for the average consumer, controlling the App Store is controlling really the state of play and the conditions for dominating the market. If they can nail this, and it looks like they're on their way to doing that, they will be in prime position. Obviously Microsoft will benefit from this as the prime backer of OpenAI. \n\nAnd in terms of AI also, I think one of the key factors here with an App Store is going to be truth, trust, some form of verification and certification model that if the same organization that dominates the App Store landscape can create some kind of, let's call it like a good housekeeping seal of approval where you can trust this product, you can trust what's coming out of this product. That would be a one two punch to really solidify a market presence. Otherwise, there's probably a lot of room for others to do that using new technical solutions that might go hand-in-hand. \n\nGoing back to some of the blockchain and crypto conversations from earlier here, I think that the crypto industry imploding was probably one of the better things that could have happened to people who really believe in blockchain as a technology. I think that there are going to be some solutions from that world, and other solutions that are going to be able to help discern and bring about a new digital landscape that has a bit more veracity built in.\n\n \n\nMy thought is that with a finite number of Bitcoin available, and the public, particularly in the U.S. and probably even in Europe, recognize that it is available to retail sources much more so than it was, it certainly got a hell of a lot, excuse me, a lot more publicity. And so I'm not so sure where I come down on this whole thing. And I think it is going to go back up, as Louis mentioned, for a bit, but then I think it's game on with regard to its future. \n\nThat's all, Phil. \n\nPhil\n\nThanks, Admiral. \n\nSo, Peter, I think this is a good place to segue to one of our reference articles. \u2018What's new in the AI revolution? Is there something new in the AI revolution?\u2019 I think that's a good point to shift over. \n\nMr. Peter Bloom\n\nThere are a couple things to do. \n\nI just want to say one thing that Lyric raised, I want to just clear my conspiracy theory.  I don't think the Chinese will, quote, control Bitcoin completely. I think they will control it at the margin. So, the real question is what happens with the incremental Bitcoin that they produce in the mines. I just want to be careful not to imply that Chinese will gain complete control for bitcoin. That was not my intent. \n\nThere are three new developments in AI, one profoundly important, and the other two just interesting. So I'll start with the two interesting ones and end with the profoundly important.\n\n \n\nSo, seeing that it's difficult for Chinese companies to navigate that policy environment, us companies, European companies are holding back. And that's something that I think China is going to have to overcome in order to win that investment in both terms of money and also in terms of sharing intellectual property, especially related to chips. \n\nThose are my quick comments. A question or a comment?\n\n\n\n\nPeter\n\nYes, I took the liberty because we often post things in the chat for each other. I just posted your podcast with Kevin Rudd in the chat just to save you the trouble. \n\nPhil\n\nThanks Peter.\n\nAdmiral Miller, if you don't mind if I ask you, because you and I were chatting back and forth and you had an engagement with some, it sounds like senior businessmen in the course of the last week. Based on what you're hearing so far this morning, if you could just offer some thoughts. \n\nAdmiral Paul David Miller\n\nFirst. I have little to add to the discussion on China.  From what was just spoken, my take on board, as any good listener would.  I think it's very key with regard to what Louis was talking about on the ET. I still call it an ETF action that's gained a lot of interest in the folks that I guess they're speculators, they're trying to figure out what's going on in this new asset class. And for most retail folks, this deep discussion about what is going on with regard to the Bank of China and other governmental institutions, I don't think has reached the retail audience, which will be the ones that sort of support these new ETF vehicles.\n\n \n\nThe key things. I think everybody is getting very confused by a lot of outsiders having a lot of comments. Nobody listened to the insider people, the people on the island and what they are saying. I think this is one of the key concerns - too much noise and too little sufficient insight.  I think that's the very first part of it. \n\nOur conversation move on to talk a little bit about the AI, and thanks to Peter.  GPT store is important. As we mentioned, one of the key things as a continuation from the last week conversation about the New York Times lawsuit with OpenAI.  GPT store probably will be something that maybe enable OpenAI to counter with the lawsuit because many people will be putting their knowledge and all this capability coded into GPT store using the GPT builder. By having everybody be able to put their knowledge inside down there openly share, OpenAI is probably able to have the community that work strongly against New York Times.  I think we will have a look and we have to see how you develop.  I\u2019m glad that you guys have started checking up the GPT store. A lot of rubbish inside down there. Everybody is experimenting, but they do have a lot of nice gems inside down there. \n\nThanks Louis for highlighting the Bitcoin ETF, what's it called - Launch as well as potential. I wouldn't say the investment opportunity, but tracking things that is probably hidden that will influence the Chinese economy. How China is countering the action from the U.\n\n \n\nBut Mr. Gao, the idea simply that the Americans and Chinese have come to some unofficial recognition, some accord, that we've come too far, and if we continue, everybody fails, and we've got to kind of try and steady the ship. \n\nI'd love to hear your comments. Thank you, \n\nMr. GAO Fei\n\nThank you Louis. It's very kind of you to say so. But I think that, of course, China is one of the major driven engines of the world economy. But of course not I, but I'm just happened to be here and I'm not expert economics. But as I mentioned, that in these few days, we have a Minister in the U.S. and have had many important dialogues with his U.S. partners. And I think that's some symbol that as the two major countries, China and the U.S. both want to add some certainty to the uncertain world. \n\nNow we are in chaos in an uncertain world. But of course, I think Taiwan is still a geopolitical risk between China and the U.S. And I also noticed that some of the U.S. retired high-rank officials or experts, they published some articles that DPP should read the Taiwan independence guidelines. \n\nSo I think in the next four years, or even in this year, so maybe the U.S. could do something to manage Taiwan issues, to add, as I said, to add some certainties to an uncertain world.\n\n And so, my view that China is driving global markets is a really significant one.  And therefore, Mr. Gao, the information and insights that you pass across are significant. \nWhat do you say to the idea that the Americans and the Chinese, despite the public rhetoric and most of it at the moment, seems to be coming from Congress rather than from the Biden administration, what do you say to the idea that there was a deal done?  Some under the table recognition that if China and America continue with the hostility in open face, we'll have higher us interest rates, which will be a wrecking ball for the Chinese economy, which is already under pressure? So, the question for me is, have we got to some economic mutual assured destruction point? Have we got to a point where the Chinese and the Americans realize if we go much further, it's chaos for everybody? So, I would say I'd like to hear your opinion on that. \n\nAnd I'd just make one observation. We've had a lot of stuff in the Middle East. We've had an attack by the Americans on the Houthis with the British Air force as well. Oil can't go up. Oil is sitting on major support. And the one big thing that we've had over the last two years is inflation. And if oil can't rally on conflagration in the Middle East, it bodes well for much lower inflation going forward, and that will be an additional flip to global markets.\n\n\n\nIn terms of the Taiwanese market, what my comment would be there is that there is no doubt to me that the status quo is a benefit to both the United States and China. Any change in the situation in Taiwan is not to our benefit. Whether it's to Taiwan's is a completely different issue. And I really agree with Mr. Gao's comments that, and also the gentleman from Singapore (Alex) that I do not think that there's going to be any major change there in spite of the wishes, the democratic wishes of the people of Taiwan. So, they're caught in the crosshairs is what others are saying.\n\nI\u2019m  happy to talk about China.  The mood, see that Kyle Bass just had know that, of course, Mike Gallagher, the Congressman from Wisconsin who is running the Select Committee on China, that they are calling in the corporate heads to grill them here in the United States about why they're doing business in China, and should they be doing business with China. There is a very negative mood. And if you look at foreign direct investment in China in 2023, it went to nothing. It's the lowest that it's ever been. So the corporate community has, despite what's going on in Washington, to open the dialogue because of the many ups and downs of Chinese policy in terms of their business environment, the abrupt - they need forward, basically, China needs forward guidance for its corporates because they wake up in the morning and they're suddenly like, the educational sector was put out of business overnight.\n\n"

    "relevant_call_notes initial": "I just returned from India where I spoke in a conference about the power of the Indian ocean. That's a paper that I presented, and I was talking to some of the senior people in India, especially after the last three assembly elections. So people are conceding that the Premier Narendra Modi and the BJP government is more likely to be established for the third consecutive time in 2024 April-May elections. \n\nThe key is in South Asia, given especially from 2015 election in Sri Lanka. That's probably the first election won by purely on Facebook was part of it. And now the digital communications, especially in politics, and changing the narrative, it's become increasingly effective, especially with AI and some of the imagery and the video productions, which is much easier than it was before, because it has takes only about $30 seconds to develop a video now using AI, I mean, you only spend about $20 to get a video for the whole month subscription.15:21:47 From Alvaro to Everyone:\n\tAre the growing North-Western Indian Ocean navigation dangers benefitting the Belt Road Initiative?\n\n15:24:44 From Alex Lin to Everyone:\n\tReplying to \"Are the growing Nort...\"\n\t\n\t1 point of concern we Asians have is not about the tension in the Taiwan Straits but the USS Carl Vinson, now docked in Singapore, which is one of the narrow channels for world trade; the other 2 are the Suez and Panama canals.And in the current time, we can foresee that AI will be enhancing the influence, enhancing the digital influence. So whoever know how to use it, whoever can use it will effectively infect the people. I use the term infect because it will be able to make the person who shaping him to who he is supposed to be by the AI, by the person controlling behind. So it is not the AI that is a problem, it's actually the so called the dark hand behind that use it. I think that is one key things that I think we have to be fully aware today.\n\nRight. Having elections in an increasingly complex landscape, with AI really driving narratives, we're seeing that very strong. And circling back to what I comment about the events that will take place this coming week in Brazil. We are seeing a lot of. There are lots of conversations about regulating AI in the political discourse here in Brazil. I'm very skeptical about that and very skeptical about the capacity of people in leadership, in different branches of the government to address those properly.(18) Inquisitiveness and ingenuity of applying technology and digital code to cultural norms.

So that's the basis of the comments that I've made.\n\nI mean, this notion of AI and information and what it's doing, and we're scared of it. We'd rather spend more time thinking about how we're going to regulate AI than what we're going to do about dealing with drone strikes at will by anybody who can spend $400 to buy a drone. \n\nWe have to start asking ourselves questions about the future of democracy. I mean, Jim Schlesinger, former Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Energy, once said that \u2018democracy is incredibly messy, but eventually, we get things right.GPT store is important. As we mentioned, one of the key things as a continuation from the last week conversation about the New York Times lawsuit with OpenAI. GPT store probably will be something that maybe enable OpenAI to counter with the lawsuit because many people will be putting their knowledge and all this capability coded into GPT store using the GPT builder. By having everybody be able to put their knowledge inside down there openly share, OpenAI is probably able to have the community that work strongly against New York Times. I think we will have a look and we have to see how you develop.  I\u2019m glad that you guys have started checking up the GPT store. A lot of rubbish inside down there. Everybody is experimenting, but they do have a lot of nice gems inside down there. \n\nThanks Louis for highlighting the Bitcoin ETF, what's it called - Launch as well as potential. I wouldn't say the investment opportunity, but tracking things that is probably hidden that will influence the Chinese economy. How China is countering the action from the U.15:43:27 From Alvaro to Everyone:\n\tWhoever is masterminding the sea lanes disruption in the Red Sea Northern Indian Ocean has a big advantage, because the goods must eventually continue to flow, so the masterminder gets to choose the timing. If the objective is to ignite a major, wider conflict, the cost vs result ratio to achieve it in that area is very favourable.\n\nAmbassador Devinda Subasinghe\n\nI think the immediate impact of the disruption of shipping lanes in the Red Sea is still to be determined. But given the high dependence on imported energy in the region, any of these disruptions will have an impact on price pressure on foreign exchange reserves, as well as domestic implications on pricing that have a social fallout. \n\nAs we look ahead to 2024 and the election cycle, there'll be elections in Bangladesh, in India, Sri Lanka. Maldives just had a presidential election, so they're done for the next term. And Pakistan will stumble its way into an election as well. So there'll be a great deal of focus on the stress points externally-generated on the economic outlook in each of these countries. \n\nThere's no clear view as to what the solutions are, but clearly the Israel-Hamas conflict is being viewed very differently in the region than most parts of the world.DAOs are designed to operate without centralized leadership, and the parameters of their decision-making powers and processes are often determined by the smart contracts governing the project in question.\n\nWhen a DAO is formed, founders frequently mint a governance token, which is a type of crypto asset that may entitle the holder to DAO membership and a certain amount of voting power on DAO decisions \u2014 typically the more tokens someone holds, the more votes they have. DAO tokens are typically initially distributed to the project\u2019s management, users, backers, and other stakeholders, but can then be bought and sold on secondary markets like any other cryptocurrency. DAO holders may also submit project proposals, which are then voted on by the rest of the group.\n\n(12)\t\u2018writing the world map\u2019 in the digital era.\nChina is rapidly developing their \u2018new development concept\u2019 based on digital technology.\n\nThe rising of generative artifical intelligence (GAI)\nOpenAI/Chat GPT\n\nMost believe that ChatGPT is the \u2018model\u2019 of GAI.

So my comment actually goes back to - I'm listening to all this, and I'm reading about what's happening in the Red Sea and the Straits and everything else. One of the things that we have to be aware of is geography because why is it that the Straits and the Red Sea are so important? It's because it makes it easier and faster to get goods from one place to the other and people make money. There is an alternative to the Straits and the Red Sea, and that's going around Africa takes a lot more time. It costs more money but ultimately that's a solution and so we need to think about what we're doing as a world by trying to keep these things open. And I understand freedom of navigation and things of that nature, but the strategic impact of shutting down the Middle East to traffic is not as important as people think in my view.\n\nJerry\n\nFollowing up on Jaymie's comment, I would agree geography. \n\nIf you look at the Straits of Malacca for instance they're not really a choke point. You can navigate your way through the Indonesian archipelago and things like that and it adds some additional costs but not a lot.\n\n That means it is quite different from how COP 28 is functioning right now, whereby all the countries would have to voice their opinions and concerns before making a conservative effort to vote and decide on things. \n\nBut if there was a stalemate, what would happen was that I would say the key countries in this new formation, this new Congress of Parties for this maritime agreement, could come together, and with consensus of two thirds of the countries, it could decide on international binding law, which came as quite surprise in the text of the agreement itself. \n\nSo we're studying this a bit further to really see what would the impact be given that I would say the boundaries of this agreement now extends past the national jurisdictions, and is really into the open seas.Speaker H:\n Use of ocean and how we are going to develop the seabase. These are going to be very important for gaining resources in the 21st century. And therefore, anchor is going to be important, not only the surface of the sea, but also how to use the seabed and the bottom and how we are going to get materials from there. There will be a lot of controversy and a lot of debate how we are going to develop the rules and regulations overseas. That is the japanese understanding. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker B:\nThank you. I think what you highlight is very important is that UNCLOS is definitely very important for us as a base for us to be able to move, especially the resources. Without that, exploitation of all the resources is going to be major, major chaos. Talking about resources, I'd like to just shift the time over to roboto from the South America. Then, in your context, how do you view this change? South America, pretty much, outside of all the quarrel and fight. Right? So how would South America view all these changes, especially the rule changes.\n\nSpeaker C:\nThank you, Alex. Hi, everybody. Happy new year. I think that maybe I'm not qualified to talk about that, Alex. Not fully informed. That's my answer to your question. I need to reflect a bit on that. Curiously, the new president of Argentina is in Antarctica today talking plastics. So Argentina is initiating a new initiative with international atomic agency and really trying to understand how microplastics are affecting Antarctica.\n\n And then it also begets the question, how are these chains with the BBNJ where science is being used? The whole guise of it is that the whole premise of the BBNJ is really about marine and biological diversity and conservation. Right? So they want to restrict activities with the BBNJ and making sure that if any activities happen, there will need to be environmental impact assessments, there need to be marine protected areas and stuff like this, sustainable fishing and all these different kind of rules.I don't think we're going to get there immediately, and I think it's going to be a wonderful cambrian explosion that's messy and noisy. But I think if anybody's poised to capitalize on that, it's obviously OpenAI right now, at least in terms of kind of western markets. \n\nBut otherwise, heading with my boss to Davos this week to talk about what our initiative is going to be, and kind of his initiative that's, broadly speaking, trying to catalyze a coalition of organizations where we bring about an Internet where people have agency over their data, a voice in how digital platforms operate, and access to the economic value they create, regardless of where they are, who they are, what their nationality is, etc. \n\nSo those conversations are going to be moving forward with folks like Nandan Nilekani from India, and people who have expertise in building digital public infrastructure, stacks of that kind. And I think if you can get the infrastructure level correct, and the digital public infrastructure level correct, you can actually have an Internet, coupled with some of these incredible App Stores, burgeoning with AI, that can have that truth and veracity built in if you leverage the right tools and mechanisms. \n\nI think OpenAI probably recognizes that in the next rush, in the next iteration of whatever the digital landscape is going to look like for the average consumer, controlling the App Store is controlling really the state of play and the conditions for dominating the market. If they can nail this, and it looks like they're on their way to doing that, they will be in prime position. Obviously Microsoft will benefit from this as the prime backer of OpenAI. \n\nAnd in terms of AI also, I think one of the key factors here with an App Store is going to be truth, trust, some form of verification and certification model that if the same organization that dominates the App Store landscape can create some kind of, let's call it like a good housekeeping seal of approval where you can trust this product, you can trust what's coming out of this product.Analog said it will harness the capabilities of edge computing to create a smooth and interconnected relationship among individuals, locations and objects, and boost speed while minimising latency.\n\nThe company said it will deliver custom solutions to tackle challenging global issues for business, public sector companies as well as health care and the environment sectors.\n\nThe AI market is projected to reach $305.9 billion this year, according to Statista. It is expected to show an annual growth rate of 15.83 per cent, resulting in a market volume of $738.8 billion by 2030.\n\nEdge computing is an emerging paradigm that refers to a range of networks and devices at or near the user. Edge is about processing data closer to where it\u2019s being generated, enabling processing at greater speeds and volumes, leading to greater action-led results in real time, according to consultancy Accenture.\n\n\u201cIn traditional AI companies, intelligence comes from historical data that is pre-trained and digitally stored \u2026 while in edge computing, intelligence emerges from live, real time sensors\u2019 data. So, this world of AI is very focused on understanding the complexities of real world in real time, understanding people, understanding places and understanding things,\u201d Mr Kipman said.\n\n\u201cWe will be harnessing data coming from millions of sensors to help businesses grow their bottom line while devising solutions that are human-centric in approach.\u201d\n\nAnalog's ability to capture and use data from the real world is the company's unique selling proposition, Mr Kipman said.\n\nWith digital technology and ubiquitous access to data, can the EAEU be based on a DAO \u2013 Decentralized Autonomous Organization of \u2018like-minded\u2019 investors, traders and buyers?\n\nA new record for cargo transported via Russia's Northern Sea Route was set in 2023 with existing nuclear icebreakers providing more than 730 vessel support services. Work continues to progress on two more nuclear-powered icebreakers.\n\nThe Northern Sea Route (NSR) runs along the north coast of Russia connecting the European and far eastern ports of Russia over a distance of 5600 kilometres.

This has sparked questions of intellectual property ownership and legal challenges in countries like the US.\nBut this is only one of the ground-up fears that AI has brought on. Some are worried about losing their jobs, while others say the technology could be used for nefarious purposes.\nAI systems used in recruitment and judicial processes  also risk perpetuating biases  , as the training data they use could be encoded with socio-economic, racial, religious and gender prejudices, experts say.\nAt the same time, the potential of using AI to do good is also there - from driving automation to predicting illness.\nAgainst this backdrop, a  race for AI regulation is taking place  to avert the risks while hopefully reaping the rewards - with action being taken at the global, regional and national levels.\nAn international milestone was logged just a month ago. The first-ever AI Safety Summit, held in the UK on Nov 1, saw the US and China coming together with more than 25 other countries to affirm the safe and responsible use of AI.\nThe landmark agreement also places \"strong responsibility\" on developers of frontier AI to test their systems for safety.\nFrontier AI often refers to the first wave of mainstream AI applications like ChatGPT.\nOn a regional scale, the European Union is in the  final stages of formulating its AI Act  , a far-reaching law that would classify AI systems by risk and mandate various development and use requirements.\nCloser to home, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is planning to  draw up governance and ethics guidelines  for AI, which analysts told CNA are expected to suggest \"safeguards\" that can mitigate identified risks.\nWhile the guide is not expected to translate into regional legislation, it could spur individual member states to create new laws or tweak existing ones to regulate the technology, they added.\nCountries behind the AI curve will also get a leg up as they can benefit from the sharing of knowledge.\n\"The public  should care about AI regulation  because the technology is more pervasive than we normally think,\" said Dr Karryl Sagun-Trajano, a research fellow for future issues and technology at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), pointing out that AI is used in sectors like healthcare, education, transport and crime fighting.\n\nIS AI COMING FOR YOUR JOB?\nThe potential for AI to upend the labour market and disrupt industries has been much discussed. A Goldman Sachs report predicts that as many as 300 million jobs could be impacted by AI automation.\nObservers have warned that faster, smarter and cheaper AI-powered chatbots could replace outsourced call centres handling customer service for many companies.\nThis is especially stark for countries like India and the Philippines, where call centres provide modest-paying work and surveys have shown automation could render over a million jobs obsolete.\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:P  olitics is SUPPOSED  to be about persuasion; but it has always been stalked by propaganda. Campaigners dissemble, exaggerate and fib. They transmit lies, ranging from bald-faced to white, through whatever means are available. Anti-vaccine conspiracies were once propagated through pamphlets instead of podcasts. A century before  covid-19  , anti-maskers in the era of Spanish flu waged a disinformation campaign. They sent fake messages from the surgeon-general via telegram (the wires, not the smartphone app). Because people are not angels, elections have never been free from falsehoods and mistaken beliefs.\nBut as the world contemplates a series of votes in 2024, something new is causing a lot of worry. In the past, disinformation has always been created by humans. Advances in  generative artificial intelligence  (  AI  )with models that can spit out sophisticated essays and create realistic images from text promptsmake synthetic propaganda possible. The fear is that disinformation campaigns may be supercharged in 2024, just as countries with a collective population of some 4bnincluding  America  , Britain, India, Indonesia, Mexico and Taiwanprepare to vote. How worried should their citizens be?\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:Unlock the Editor's Digest for free\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\nChina has significantly expanded its bailout lending as its Belt and Road Initiative blows up following a series of debt write-offs, scandal-ridden projects and allegations of corruption.\nA study published on Tuesday shows China granted $104bn worth of rescue loans to developing countries between 2019 and the end of 2021. The figure for these years is almost as large as the country's bailout lending over the previous two decades.\nThe  study  by researchers at AidData, World Bank, Harvard Kennedy School and Kiel Institute for the World Economy is the first known attempt to capture total Chinese rescue lending on a global basis.\nBetween 2000 and the end of 2021,  China  undertook 128 bailout operations in 22 debtor countries worth a total of $240bn.\nChina's emergence as a highly influential \"lender of last resort\" presents critical challenges for western-led institutions such as the IMF, which have sought to safeguard global financial stability since the end of the second world war.\n\"The global financial architecture is becoming less coherent, less institutionalised and less transparent,\" said Brad Parks, executive director of AidData at William & Mary in the US. \"Beijing has created a new global system for cross-border rescue lending, but it has done so in an opaque and uncoordinated way.\"\nRising global interest rates and the strong appreciation of the dollar have raised concerns about the ability of developing countries to repay their creditors. Several sovereigns have run into distress, with a lack of co-ordination among creditors blamed for prolonging some crises.\nSri Lanka's President Ranil Wickremesinghe  called on China and other creditors last week  to quickly reach a compromise on debt restructuring after the IMF approved a $3bn four-year lending programme for his nation.\nChina has declined to participate in multilateral debt resolution programmes even though it is a member of the IMF. Ghana, Pakistan and other troubled debtors that owe large amounts to China are closely watching Sri Lanka's example.\n\"[China's] strictly bilateral approach has made it more difficult to co-ordinate the activities of all major emergency lenders,\" said Parks.\nSeveral of the 22 countries to which China has made rescue loans  including Argentina, Belarus, Ecuador, Egypt, Laos, Mongolia, Pakistan, Suriname, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Ukraine and Venezuela  are also recipients of IMF support.\nHowever, there are big differences between IMF programmes and Chinese bailouts. One is that Chinese money is not cheap. \"A typical rescue loan from the IMF carries a 2 per cent interest rate,\" said the study. \"The average interest rate attached to a Chinese rescue loan is 5 per cent.\"\nBeijing also does not offer bailouts to all  Belt and Road  borrowers in distress. Big recipients of BRI financing, which represent a significant balance sheet risk for Chinese banks, are more likely to receive emergency aid.\n\"Beijing is ultimately trying to rescue its own banks. That's why it has gotten into the risky business of international bailout lending,\" said Carmen Reinhart, a Harvard Kennedy School professor and former chief economist at the World Bank Group.\nChina's lending comes in two forms. The first is through a \"swap line\" facility, where renminbi is disbursed by the People's Bank of China, the central bank, in return for domestic currency. About $170bn was disbursed in this way. The second is through direct balance of payments support, with $70bn pledged, mostly from state-owned Chinese banks.\nThe BRI is the world's largest-ever transnational infrastructure programme. The American Enterprise Institute, a Washington-based think-tank, has put the value of China-led infrastructure projects and other transactions classified as \"Belt and Road\" at $838bn between 2013 and the end of 2021.\nThe bailout bonanza reveals shortcomings in the design of a scheme described by Chinese leader Xi Jinping as \"the project of the century\".\nOne issue, said Christoph Trebesch of the Kiel Institute, was that Chinese lenders \"really went into many countries that turned out to have particularly severe problems\".\nOther deficiencies derived from a dearth of feasibility studies and a general lack of transparency, according to the study.\nBeijing pushed back on Tuesday against the criticisms of its foreign lending practices, with foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning telling reporters that China had entered financing agreements with developing countries \"based on the principles of openness and transparency\". She added that China \"has never compelled countries to take its loans, or ever attached political strings to such agreements\".\nSeveral projects became cause clbre for how not to undertake development lending. An infamous $1bn \"road to nowhere\" in Montenegro remains unfinished and dogged by corruption allegations, construction delays and environmental issues.\n\"White elephants\" such as Sri Lanka's Hambantota port and Lotus Tower are seen as symptoms of the country's debt crisis, while more than 7,000 cracks were found in an Ecuadorean dam built by Chinese contractors near an active volcano.\nAdditional reporting by Maiqi Ding in Beijing\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:Beijing needs to beef up technological collaborations to underpin and enhance the Belt and Road Initiative, analysts say as the ambitious plan advocated by President Xi Jinping marks its 10th anniversary this year amid growing geopolitical uncertainties.\nThe expert assessments, made at a seminar hosted by the Ministry of Science and Technology at the weekend, came as Beijing's initiative to link economies into a China-centred trading network still reports an overall low level of technological development and insufficient collaboration with its partners.\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:BEIJING: Saudi Arabia's investment minister met with China's commerce and industry chiefs in Beijing on Sunday (Dec 10) and discussed expanding cooperation in trade, investment and technology, the Chinese ministries said.\nChina is willing to work with Saudi Arabia to jointly promote China's Belt and Road infrastructure investment program and Saudi Arabia's \"Vision 2030\" initiative, the ministry quoted Commerce Minister Wang Wentao as saying after the meeting with Saudi Investment Minister Khalid Al-Falih, adding that the two countries would also expand cooperation in energy and resources, infrastructure and technology.\nThe Vision 2030 plan aims to diversify the economy of the world's biggest oil producer away from hydrocarbon income and includes big infrastructure projects and an expanded focus on the private sector.\nAl-Falih also met China's Minister of Industry and Information Technology Jin Zhuanglong.\nThe ministry quoted Jin as saying that China was open to working with Saudi Arabia on new energy vehicles, aircraft, photovoltaics and artificial intelligence, as well as cooperating to safeguard global industrial supply chains.\nChina's ties with Saudi Arabia have deepened recently, with the Saudi energy minister declaring in June that his country would seek to collaborate, not compete, with China.\nThe relationship, anchored in hydrocarbon ties, has expanded, with the two countries signing a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement and a series of investment agreements in December 2022.\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:N  ARENDRA MODI  aspires to turn India into a  vishwaguru  , or \"teacher to the world\". But what pedagogical gift, beyond its prime minister's sage-like appearance, does a rapidly growing and ambitious India have for other countries?\nTechnological prowess, is the Modi government's answer. In a little over a decade India has built a collection of public-facing digital platforms that have transformed its citizens' lives. Once known as the \"India Stack\", they have been rebranded \"digital public infrastructure\" (  DPI  ) as the number and ambition of the platforms have grown. It is this  DPI  that India hopes to exportand in the process build its economy and influence. Think of it as India's low-cost, software-based version of China's infrastructure-led Belt and Road Initiative. \"The benefits of digital transformation should not be confined to a small part of the human race,\" said Mr Modi at the  G20  summit in Indonesia last year.\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:In 1967, after a months-long holiday in Mauritius, then 12-year-old Louis Humbert along with his mother and brothers sought to return to his native Chagos, a chain of 60 islands dotting the Indian Ocean. They learned the islands were \"closed\".\nThat was because the US began setting up a military base on the Chagossian island of Diego Garcia in 1966. Recognising its strategic value, the US gradually removed the native population on and around the remote atoll after reaching a secret deal with  Britain  , which, until 1968, colonised Mauritius, which Diego Garcia was once a part of.\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:A  \"  FREE AND  open Indo-Pacific\", intended to encompass both the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, is the hottest geopolitical slogan. When strategists talk about the Indo-Pacific, however, they often mean just the Pacific, and then only the far-western part, around the South China Sea and the East China Sea. It is there that a struggle for primacy is at its fiercest between America, dominant since the second world war, and a resurgent China. Yet the Indian Ocean, relatively neglected until recently, is now having a moment.\nThe economic dynamism of its rim and great importance of the ocean as a hub for trade in goods and energy have long been recognised. Now its strategic significance is catching up. No single power holds sway in this ocean, and perhaps never will. Yet China is making inroads into its waters and other navies also jostle there for influence. A new oceanic era shaped by great-power rivalry has begun. Smaller Indian Ocean countries wonder whether they will be victims of it, or beneficiaries.\n\nU  ntil a few  years ago, the term \"  Indo-Pacific  \" was hardly uttered in international affairs. Now many countries have adopted so-called Indo-Pacific strategies, including America, Australia, Britain, France, India, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines and even Mongolia. South Korea joined the pack in December. The main Asian holdout is China, which scorns the phrase. That is key to understanding what the Indo-Pacific is all about.\nOutside geopolitics, the term, implying a conjoined perspective on the Indian Ocean and the even vaster Pacific, is not new. Its first recorded use was by a British colonial lawyer and ethnographer in the mid-19th century. Patterns of human trade and exchange had already spanned the two oceans for millennia, with Islam spreading eastward from the Middle East and Hinduism and Buddhism fanning outwards from India. In more recent decades scientists have grasped how the circulation and biogeography of the two oceans are closely connected. The great story of  Asia  can be usefully framed by the two-ocean notion of an Indo-Pacific.\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:FINDING COOLING SOLUTIONS\nWith daily temperatures projected to rise by as much as 5 degrees Celsius by the end of this century, there is  greater urgency to find ways to cool spaces and people down  , without adding to global warming.\nThat includes finding alternatives to air-conditioning, which uses lots of electricity and emits heat and greenhouse gases.\n\"By reducing the use of air-conditioning, we can reduce our energy consumption and carbon emissions from our building,\" said Mr Lei Yue, a research associate and PhD candidate in the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Department of the Built Environment, part of the College of Design and Engineering.\nMr Lei is part of a team testing out a mixed-mode concept of ventilation in an office setting.\nIt combines natural ventilation, ceiling fans and spot cooling at desks, to automatically maintain ideal indoor temperatures.\nSuch a system is estimated to use around half as much energy to cool a space,  compared to air-conditioning  , explained Mr Lei.\n\"It's an important step in mitigating the impact of Singapore's changing climate,\" he said.\nThe Singapore Green Building Council (SGBC) has also called for the country to change the way it builds, in order to adapt to the warming weather.\nThe sector is paying heed in several areas, such as using software to look at building orientation and other ways to minimise the impact from solar heat, said the council's president Lee Ang Seng.\nNatural ventilation systems, for instance, could factor in seasonal wind directions, he said.\n\"Then we look at urban greenery incorporated into buildings, which helps to reduce the indoor and ambient temperatures,\" added Mr Lee.\n\"We will be able to build this wall using membranes. The membrane will serve as a function to separate the water, and on top you still can have a concrete block,\" Professor Chu Jian, Chair of NTU's School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, told CNA.\n\"This concrete block can also be used for other functions. For example, inside the concrete block, you can use it for highways and on top  you can still have your beach (and) your slope for your intertidal zone.\"\nNational water agency PUB said it is planning its policies based on a 2m rise in sea levels  a possibility by the year 2150 in a high emissions scenario, according to the National Climate Change Study.\n\nIt has forced major shipping companies to send ships around the Cape of Good Hope rather than through the Suez Canal, resulting in much longer transit times and greater fuel, crew and other operating costs. Companies that prefer to take the risk are still saddled with marine insurance rates for war risk that have greatly increased of late.\n\nMoreover, most recently a grave new threat has emerged - that of a semi-submersible sea-based drone. These are particularly dangerous as they are very hard to see and destroy, and designed to hit their target at the waterline, its most vulnerable point.\nShould such a drone strike a large container ship or oil or gas tanker, the damage could be catastrophic with ships sunk, crews killed and appalling environmental consequences.\n\nESCALATION IS A POOR ALTERNATIVE\nWarship numbers and the schedules of individual shipping companies will not allow regular convoying for protection. So, Operation Prosperity Guardian will most likely be conducted by means of carefully chosen and patrolled shipping routes, with concentrations of naval forces in areas where the threat is considered to be at its highest.\nAlthough this is a complex, demanding and expensive task, escalating the response may be a dangerous alternative.\nWith the US and UK having launched first strikes against targets linked to the Houthis, any retaliatory action could endanger the precarious ceasefire in the Yemeni civil war and runs the risk of widening still further the conflict already engulfing part of the region.\nSo both by defending the trading system on which the whole world depends and trying to limit the dangers of an even greater war in the area, Operation Prosperity Guardian is an important exercise in the defence of global peace and prosperity.\nSmall states like Singapore can do their part too. As a small island state that depends on the global maritime system for its security and survival, Singapore must do what it can to support and uphold the multilateral rules-based system.\nGeoffrey Till is Professor and Adviser to the Maritime Security Programme and Jane Chan is Senior Fellow and Coordinator of the Maritime Security Programme, at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.\n\nFORGING A PATH TO FINANCIAL INCLUSION\nHeadquartered in Singapore, Ant International is poised to transform financial services with its growing global presence. With its strategic focus on the 4Ts (travel, trade, technology and talent), the international arm of Ant Group is developing cutting-edge digital solutions designed to  bridge the digital divide  and power the future of global commerce with digital innovation that will benefit a range of communities, from consumers to SMEs and merchants worldwide.\nSaid Mr Yang: \"Despite global economic uncertainties, evolving financial infrastructures, rapid digitalisation and tech advancements offer unparalleled opportunities. Our focus on travel, trade, technology and talent lays the cornerstone for global inclusion and prosperity. We will accelerate innovations in digital payments and commerce to link up these areas of global collaboration.\"\nOne such innovation under the travel pillar is  Alipay+  , the company's flagship cross-border mobile payment service. With a network encompassing 57 countries and regions, it now connects over 88 million merchants with 1.5 billion user accounts, enabling effortless travel and cross-border transactions. Merchants can also leverage the Alipay+ D-store to digitalise their payment processes and operations across multiple platforms and social media channels.\nIn the latter half of this year, Alipay+ saw a 30 per cent growth in total payment volume and a significant increase in daily transactions.\nMost recently, it launched a year-end campaign with partner e-wallets to promote sustainable cross-border travel. Focusing on popular Asian destinations such as Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand, Japan and South Korea, the campaign offered diverse deals through collaborations with global brands and local businesses to ensure a broad selection for travellers. Additionally, it aimed to foster responsible travel behaviours by rewarding the use of digital payments and public transport, as well as promoting exploration of local culture in an effort to support local economies.\nAnt International's technology pillar is embodied by Antom, a suite of platform-level services and toolkits, to help merchants grow their revenue and consumer base across Asia and beyond.\nIn the realm of trade, global digital payments and financial services provider  WorldFirst  (which Ant Group acquired in 2019) has served over one million SMEs engaged in international trade, and plans to extend its solutions to a broader market in Southeast Asia next year. As part of this effort to help SMEs expand globally, it launched the Global Voyage programme in 2022 to help them streamline the process of opening stores on around 30 major e-commerce platforms  such as Amazon and AliExpress  within 24 hours.\nFurther enhancing its portfolio, WorldFirst also signed a memorandum of understanding with Asset World Corporation (AWC), Thailand's leading integrated lifestyle real estate group, to introduce a suite of payment and digital financial solutions for AWC's various business operations.\nIn the first nine months of this year, there was a notable increase in business-to-business buyers from emerging markets using the platform to import goods from China. This surge in activity boosted the total trade value on WorldFirst's platform by 83 per cent compared to the previous year.\nSimilarly,  ANEXT Bank  , Ant International's digital wholesale bank in Singapore  which is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore  focuses on supporting regional micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in their pursuit of international expansion. Since its inception in July 2022, it has seen an average 40 per cent month-on-month increase in cross-border transactions, underscoring its growing importance in the sector. Today, over 65 per cent of its customers are made up of MSMEs.\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:I  nternational trade  has become politically unpopular in America in recent years. Increasingly, voices at either end of the political spectrum have set the terms of debate. For some, these calls have been prompted by a view that international trade damages workers and diminishes America's ability to produce at home. For others, such calls are cloaked in the language of national securityin particular, concern about the rise of China. American firms should not be trading technology or putting money in China's pockets, they say, because doing so is tantamount to strengthening a rival and growing adversary. Calls for protectionism generally, and decoupling from China particularly, are growing louder.\nAmerica must vigorously defend its strategic interests, of course. This is particularly true with advanced technologies, especially those that involve national security or economic capabilities. Given the dual-use nature of emerging technologies, such as underwater acoustic sensors and artificial-intelligence applications that can be employed both for peaceful and military aims, Washington needs to set thoughtful boundaries around acceptable exports to China, as well as around investments in Chinese firms that develop products which could threaten American security. Washington should not tolerate China or any other country stealing or forcing the transfer of intellectual property, unreasonably aiding national champions or unfairly flooding overseas markets. And America must also protect critical supply chains, such as for advanced batteries, semiconductors and medicines.\n\nT  HE WORLD'S  supply chains have taken a knock yet again. Russia's invasion of Ukraine provoked the biggest commodity shock since 1973, and one of the worst disruptions to wheat supplies in a century. Countries from Hungary to Indonesia are banning food exports to ensure supply at home. The West has issued sanctions against Russia, depriving it of all sorts of parts and technologies.\nThe strain on globalisation comes on top of the effects of the financial crisis of 2007-09, Brexit, President Donald Trump and the pandemic. For years measures of global integration have gone south. Between 2008 and 2019 world trade, relative to global  GDP  , fell by about five percentage points. Tariffs and other barriers to trade are piling up. Global flows of long-term investment fell by half between 2016 and 2019. Immigration is lower too, and not just because of border closures.\nThe war in Ukraine stands to accelerate another profound shift in global trade flows, by pitting large autocracies against liberal democracies. Such confrontation happened during the cold war, too. But this time autocracies are bigger, richer and more technologically sophisticated. Their share in global output, trade and innovation has risen, and they are key links in many supply chains. Attempts to drift apart, therefore, will bring new consequences, and costs, for the world economy.\nAfter the second world war democracies ruled the economic roost. In 1960 America, Britain, Canada, France, Italy and Japan accounted for about 40% of global exports. Autocracies, by contrast, were economically unimportant on the world stage. The Soviet Union accounted for 4% of global trade; China barely featured in the statistics. Average  GDP  per head across the communist bloc was a tenth of America's. The West was locked in a fierce ideological battle with communist countries, filled with proxy wars and nuclear scares. But in economic terms there was no contest.\nTheir economies were also largely unintegrated. One observer in the late 1950s reckoned that trade between the  USSR  and America was so small that a big shipment could double the total from one month to another. The exceptions in east-west tradea bit of Russian gas to Europe; a wheat deal in 1972; a vodka-for-Pepsi swap from 1974were few. A study published by the  IMF  days before the Soviet Union fell said that \"foreign direct investment in the  USSR  has been minimal to date\".\nThe communist bloc played by its own rules. Soviet external economic activity largely took place within  COMECON  , a group of sympathetic countries (China and the  USSR  barely traded with each other from the late 1950s, having fallen out). Trade in  COMECON  took place not via money-for-stuff, but in the form of a peculiar system of barteroil for manufactured goods, sayagreed by governments.\nFrom the late 1970s onwards, autocratic regimes began to open up. In part this was the result of an ideological change, first apparent in China. The death of Chairman Mao in 1976 allowed hitherto heretical views to emerge. \"Unless it could expand and modernise its economy more rapidly than it had done in previous decades, China would remain poor, weak and vulnerable,\" wrote Aaron Friedberg of Princeton University in a paper published in 2018, describing the ideas of Deng Xiaoping, the leader who spearheaded China's opening up in the 1980s. A focus on class struggle gave way to a desire for modernisation and development. Further momentum for globalisation came from the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.\nThe West, on the whole, welcomed and encouraged economic liberalisation, believing that it could be a force for good (and for large profits). By bringing countries into the global trading system it would be possible to raise living standards, as well as foster democracy and freedom. A globalised world would also be a more peaceful one, the argument went.\nIn the 1990s globalisation took off. Trade boomed. Annual global flows of foreign direct investment (  FDI  , including purchases of companies and the construction of new factories) rose by a factor of six. In 1990 Russia's first McDonald's opened, in Moscow;  KFC  set up shop a few years later. Russian oil companies began directing their exports towards the West. Between 1985 and 2015 Chinese goods exports to America rose by a factor of 125.\nLiving standards certainly went up. The number of people living in extreme poverty has fallen by 60% since 1990. Some formerly closed countries have utterly changed. The average Estonian is now only marginally poorer than the average Italian.\nThe other hoped-for benefit of globalisationpolitical liberalisationhas faltered, however. Our World in Data, a research organisation, puts countries into four groups, ranging from most to least free: \"liberal democracies\", such as America and Japan; more flawed \"electoral democracies\", such as Poland and Sri Lanka; \"electoral autocracies\", such as Turkey and Hungary; and \"closed autocracies\", such as China and Vietnam, where citizens have no real choice over their leader.\nClassifying political regimes is not an exact science, and involves making assumptions and judgments. Our World In Data counts India as an electoral autocracy since 2019, for instance, which some other sources do not agree with. Nonetheless, it helps give an idea of a broader trend: the waning might of liberal democracies.\nThe share of political regimes that were liberal democracies rose from 11% in 1970 to 23% in 2010. But democracy has retrenched since. Most of the 1.9bn people living in closed autocracies now reside in just one country: China. But lesser forms of autocracy are on the rise, such as in Turkey, where President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has consolidated power during his two decades in office (see chart 1).\nUsing data from the World Bank, the  IMF  and elsewhere, we divide the global economy into two. We estimate that today the autocratic world (ie, closed and electoral autocracies) accounts for over 30% of global  GDP  , more than double its share at the end of the cold war. Its share of global exports has soared over that period. The combined market value of its listed firms represented just 3% of the global total in 1989. Now it represents 30% (see chart 2).\nChina is by far the biggest non-democracy in economic terms, with a dollar  GDP  roughly two-thirds of America's, making up over half of our group of autocracies. But others, such as Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Vietnam, have also gained in economic clout over the past 30 years.\nAutocracies are now an especially serious rival to democracies when it comes to investment and innovation. In 2020 their governments and firms invested $9trn in everything from machinery and equipment to the construction of roads and railways. Democracies invested $12trn. Autocracies received more  FDI  than democracies between 2018 and 2020. And since the mid-1990s their share of patent applications has gone from 5% to over 60%. China dominates patenting, but on almost all our other measures the economic power of autocracies has soared even after China is excluded from our calculations.\nMany autocracies have remained steadfastly mercantilist. China, for instance, opened its domestic markets where it suited it, but kept whole sectors closed off to allow domestic champions to rise. Nonetheless autocracies have become integrated with democracies to an extent that would have been unthinkable during the cold war. Vietnam, which has been ruled by a single party for decades, for instance, has become a pivotal link in the global manufacturing supply chain. The kingdoms and emirates of the Middle East are vital sources of oil and gas.\nWe estimate that roughly one-third of democracies' goods imports come from other political regimes. The codependency in some markets is clear. Democracies produce about two-thirds of the oil necessary to meet their daily needs. The rest must come from somewhere else. Half of the coffee that fills Europeans' cups comes from places where people have weak political rights. And that is before getting to precious metals and rare earths.\nIntegration goes far beyond trade. American multinationals employ 3m people outside democracies, a rise of 90% in the past decade (their total foreign employment has increased by a third). Investors from democracies hold over a third of the autocratic world's total stock of inward  FDI  . Autocracies have built up huge foreign reserves, now worth more than $7trn and often denominated in \"free\" currencies like the dollar and the euro.\n\nBROKEN DREAM\nThis intimacy is now under threat as a third, darker period comes into view. Even before the war in Ukraine, powerful countries were losing interest in a truly global presence. Instead they were seeking to rely more on themselves or to dominate their immediate geographical area. Their new thinking is becoming increasingly enshrined in strategy and policy.\nThe waning appetite for globalisation has a few causes. One relates to greater consumer awareness in the West about human-rights abuses in places such as China and Vietnam. Polls in Western countries regularly find that a high share of respondents support boycotting Chinese goods (whether they would actually do so is another matter). Western companies are being pressed to source goods elsewhere. Concerns over the national-security implications of trade and investment, including industrial espionage, have also risen.\nAutocracies have their own worries. One is that too much integration can cause Western culture to seep across borders, weakening autocratic rule. Deng himself identified the dilemma: \"If you open the window for fresh air, you have to expect some flies to blow in.\"\nAnother, bigger worry relates to power. Being part of global supply chains means being vulnerable to sanctions. This was clear from an early stage. In 1989 China faced sanctions after the crackdown in Tiananmen Square. The next year America placed Cuba, El Salvador, Jordan, Kenya, Romania and Yemen under sanctions for various infractions. Several rounds of Western sanctions on Russia, first in 2014 and then again today, bring the message home still more forcefully.\nAlready there is evidence of a crude decoupling. In 2014 America banned Huawei, a Chinese tech firm, from bidding on American government contracts. In 2018 Mr Trump started a trade war with China, with the goal of forcing it to make changes to what America said were \"unfair trade practices\", including the theft of intellectual property.  FDI  flows between China and America are now just $5bn a year, down from nearly $30bn five years ago.\nRecent policy announcements and trade deals shed some light on the probable direction of globalisation as the world's most powerful democracies and autocracies turn away from each other. Countries are signing smaller, regional trade deals instead; democracies are banding together, as are autocracies; and many countries are also seeking greater self-reliance.\nBegin with regional trade deals, the number of which is booming. In 2020 China signed an agreement with 14 other Asian countries, mostly non-democracies. In that year the  ASEAN  group of South-East Asian countries became China's biggest trading partner, replacing the  EU  . In Africa, meanwhile, most countries have ratified the African Continental Free Trade Area.\nCountries with shared political systems are also coming closer. The CoRe Partnership, an agreement between America and Japan, launched last year and is designed to promote co-operation in new technologies from mobile networks to biotech. The  US  -  EU  Trade and Technology Council, the pointed ambition of which is to promote \"the spread of democratic, market-oriented values\", is working on climate change and strengthening supply chains.\nAutocracies are also forming their own blocs. The stock of long-term investment from the autocratic world into China rose by over a fifth in 2020, even as the amount of investment from autocracies into America barely budged. Saudi Arabia is reportedly mulling selling oil to China in yuan, rather than dollars. Long-term investment from autocracies into increasingly illiberal India rose by 29% in 2020.\nLarge countries in particular, meanwhile, are also turning inward. A big focus of President Joe Biden's administration, for instance, is \"supply-chain resilience\", which in part involves efforts to encourage domestic production. China's turn in 2020 towards a \"dual circulation\" strategy includes an attempt to rely less on global suppliers. It wants to release its rivals' grip on \"chokehold\" industries, such as chipmaking equipment, which it fears could be used to strangle its rise. India, too, has turned towards self-reliance.\nMany of these efforts could come at a price. Autocracies are notoriously prone to pursuing their own self-interests, rather than banding together. History shows that withdrawing from global trade and investment networks carries huge costs. In 1808 America came close to autarky as a result of a self-imposed embargo on international shipping. Research by Douglas Irwin of Dartmouth College suggests that the ban cost about 8% of America's gross national product. More recently, many studies have found that it was primarily American firms that paid for Mr Trump's tariffs. Brexit has slowed growth and investment in Britain.\nRussia's attempt at self-reliance, by pursuing import substitution on a large scale, building up foreign-exchange reserves and developing parallel technological networks, shows just how hard it is to cut yourself off from the global economy.  Sanctions  by the West rendered much of its reserves useless overnight. The economy was struggling even before the war, and has since gone off a cliff. Unemployment is likely to soar as foreign firms leave the country.\nThe risk, though, is that countries draw the opposite lesson from Russia: that less integration, rather than more, is the best way to protect themselves from economic pain. The world would become more fractured and mutually suspiciousnot to mention poorer than it could have been.  \nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, business and markets,  sign up to Money Talks  , our weekly newsletter.\nRead more of our recent coverage of the  Ukraine crisis\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:Marmalade  made the front page  of this newspaper's business section last week.

These projects and related research have produced quantitative and qualitative findings that inform the questions just posed. Quantitative analysis utilizes micro-data on Chinese outbound FDI and construction projects in all countries from 2010 to 2019.\nFirst, analysis of the project-level data finds that the BRI significantly increased Chinese investments in BRI countries (defined as the originally targeted 67 countries). Both FDI and construction projects increased by more than 50% in BRI countries after the Initiative began compared to changes in non-BRI countries. When we analyze the determinants of the flow of Chinese FDI to different countries before and after the Initiative began, we find that compared to the years before the BRI (2010-2013), since the BRI began the importance of economic fundamentals (such as GDP growth rates) has declined, while the importance of the countries' governance quality (including measures of political stability, corruption, rule of law, regulatory quality, and government effectiveness) has increased. These findings suggest that outbound FDI flows are less profit-motivated under the BRI, raising concerns about their economic viability. At the same time, the greater importance of governance factors contradicts the narrative that China is seeking to exploit corrupt, poorly governed countries. Encouraged to make investments in BRI countries, many Chinese companies apparently seek to avoid countries with high governance risk. We find that this is true for investments by both state-owned firms and private firms.\nWhat has been the impact of the BRI on international trade? A recent paper by Amber Yao LI, Associate Professor in the Department of Economics, and co-authors finds that the BRI significantly increases bilateral trade flows between BRI countries. The Initiative also increases the total trade volume of BRI countries, especially imports. With respect to trade with China, China's imports from BRI countries increases after the Initiative, while exports from China to BRI countries do not change appreciably. These findings are consistent with China using FDI in BRI countries to secure access to resources (e.g., energy, minerals) or to outsource production of goods sold in China. The finding of positive trade impacts is important for two reasons. First, much research in economics has found a strong link between trade and growth. Second, if the BRI expands trade with member countries, it may have the potential to counter the trend towards deglobalization.\nDiplomatic and economic objectives\nSince China's objectives for the BRI are diplomatic as well as economic, it is of interest to ask whether the Initiative has increased China's soft power. To shed light on this question, in an ongoing project with coauthors, I examine how sentiment towards China in different countries has been affected by the Initiative. Machine learning methods are used to analyze the positive or negative sentiment found in over one million media articles about China published globally from 2013 to 2019. We find that in most parts of the world, sentiment towards China has become increasingly negative in recent years. This is even true in countries receiving the most FDI from China under the BRI (Indonesia, Pakistan, Russia). Further analysis finds that sentiment towards China is inversely related to the amount of FDI or construction projects received from China. This negative correlation is more apparent when the FDI projects are in the resource sector, and when they are made by state-owned enterprises. Thus, China does not appear to be increasing its soft power through the BRI and may even be harming it.\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy would more Chinese investment in a country increase negative sentiment towards China even though there is evidence that the investments are having positive development impacts? Qualitative research in countries in Southeast Asia as well as other parts of the world finds that some Chinese projects are very unpopular locally because they harm the environment or have poor labor relations (for example, fail to obey local labor regulations or customary practices, or hire Chinese rather than local workers, etc.). Even one bad project in a country can attract considerable media attention and severely damage the reputation of Chinese firms. Opposition politicians may mobilize support by criticizing China or the close relationship between government leaders and China. China has drawn criticism from climate activists for being the only international donor that continues to finance coal energy projects. In many instances, China has funded projects requested by government leaders without doing sufficient due diligence to assess environmental and social impacts or to reach out to local communities. Some Chinese companies are gradually learning from their mistakes, by funding more renewable energy projects and focusing more on corporate social responsibility. A main conclusion from these findings is that if the BRI is to realize its lofty objectives, China would be well-advised to put greater priority on ensuring that Belt and Road projects meet high standards with respect to both economic viability and environmental and social impacts. The record of Western foreign aid programs to the developing world shows convincingly that money does not buy development.\nA commitment to finish\nHow has deglobalization due to the US-China trade war and the pandemic affected the implementation of the BRI? A bilateral trade war naturally diverts economic activity to third party countries which actually could increase investment incentives in BRI countries. For example, Chinese companies and multinationals who manufacture goods in China and export them to the US have an incentive to relocate production from China to other countries to avoid punitive tariffs and diversify risk exposure. Producers in BRI countries may have greater opportunities to export to both China and the US. At the same time, if the trade conflict slows growth in the world's two largest economies or spreads protectionism to other countries, this could have a chilling effect on foreign investment and trade globally. In this light, the recent signing of the world's largest trade pact, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) signed by all ASEAN countries, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, demonstrates that countries in East Asia are committed to expanding rather reducing economic integration efforts. The agreement is complementary to the Belt and Road Initiative in that it facilitates globalization of supply chains and increases the benefits of trade and foreign investment.\nDaily, Monday to Friday\n\nChina at a Glance Newsletter\n\nYour daily must-read of essential stories from China, including politics, economy and current affairs.\n\nBy submitting, you consent to receiving marketing emails from SCMP.

Most infrastructure and investment projects were delayed by at least three to six months due to disruption caused by lockdowns, travel bans, and the preoccupation of government leaders and firm managers with responding to the crisis. The pandemic was a major economic shock to nearly all countries, even those that did a good job controlling the outbreak. This led many governments to re-prioritise spending commitments, which led to the cancellation of some BRI projects. On the other hand, some governments with sufficient resources, such as the Philippines, decided to increase infrastructure spending as a way to stimulate their economies. Many economies, including the US and China, are bouncing back strongly in 2021.\nTo sum up, China's ambitious effort to promote greater connectivity with other countries through the BRI has created new infrastructure, increased investment, and expanded trade in BRI countries, but also has encountered criticisms that have undermined the Initiative's ability to win hearts and minds in BRI countries. Nonetheless, the BRI is not going away any time soon. The recent turn towards deglobalization and growing anti-China sentiment create a challenging environment for the Initiative, but leaders in China and in most BRI countries remain committed to pursuing greater economic integration even as they adjust to a more confrontational and competitive relationship between the world two largest economies.\nMedia Sentiment Towards China in Belt and Road Countries Receiving the Most Chinese Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), 2013-2019\n\nReference\nHKUST Institute for Emerging Market Studies and United Overseas Bank (2020).

Issuance of yuan-denominated loans in the city also soared.\nFor China, the growing share of yuan in global financing ticks one of its main internationalisation priorities, though the recent burst of activity appears to have been overwhelmingly for domestic use.\n\"Panda bonds are steadily promoting the renminbi's function as a funding currency\", the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said a report last month. It has been motivating banks to lend to offshore firms and allowed broader use of yuan outside China.\nThe yuan's share as a global currency in trade finance jumped to 5.8 per cent in September from 3.91 per cent at the start of the year, trumping the euro for the first time, according to SWIFT. The international payments system dominates the traffic of letters of credit - a form of short-term financing that facilitates trade.\nRegardless, it barely scrapes the dollar's dominance at 84.2 per cent.\nSeveral gauges of yuan internationalisation - including a Standard Chartered Bank tracker measuring the global use of the yuan, and Bank of China's Cross-border RMB Index (CRI) - all hit record highs this year.\nTOO EARLY TO CELEBRATE\nHowever, analysts point to the limited use and circulation of international yuan bond proceeds so far, and say it's premature to trumpet internationalisation.\nGerman automaker Volkswagen Group told Reuters it will use its inaugural 1.5 billion yuan panda bond proceeds only for its onshore China business.\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group also plans to use its panda bond proceeds to support a car leasing business in China.\nYuan internationalisation \"isn't going as well as the headline figures might suggest,\" said Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at Capital Economics.\n\"It's still the case that more than half of cross-border transactions using the yuan are between the mainland and Hong Kong. This is a very local form of internationalisation.\"\nMaybank's Lim concurs. \"We should be discerning of the cross-border transactions that are between China and Hong Kong versus China and the rest of the world.\"\nWithin trade finance and payments, the yuan's use is largely limited to developing countries friendly to China, such as those joining its Belt and Road initiative.\n\"There has been a surge in use of the yuan to settle trade, but only within specific bilateral channels: countries like Russia, Argentina, Pakistan and Nigeria,\" Williams said.\nCountries that are geopolitically aligned with the U.S. \"are showing no willingness to switch over to using the yuan. That suggests that global use of the yuan in trade will hit a low ceiling.\"\n($1 = 7.2421 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n\nIt's been 10 years since China launched its Belt & Road initiative and Beijing is holding their 3rd BRI forum for International Cooperation today. It's a 2-day summit and Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to attend the event and meet President Xi Jinping in person. The Belt & Road Initiative has been faced with criticism for burdening developing nations with debt. But for countries along the Belt and Road, imports and exports have more than doubled since the launch of the ambitious infrastructure project.  Alex Capri  is Senior Lecturer from NUS Business School. He describes the success and failures of the project by Beijing.\n\nOVER US$7 BILLION TO BUILD\nThe Chinese-made bullet train, called \"Whoosh\", is part of China's Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.\nBuilt by a joint Chinese-Indonesian venture PT Kereta Cepat Indonesia China (KCIC), which is made up of four Indonesian state companies and Beijing's China Railway International, it has cost more than US$7 billion.\n\"In order to shift public behaviour, the government needs to provide some kind of incentive including setting the right price for the high-speed train,\" Dr Negara told CNA's Asia Now.\nThe ticket prices have not been finalised. Free trial rides on the bullet train, which have been underway since the second week of September, will be extended and fees will be implemented in the middle of October.\nAccording to reports, tickets will range from 250,000 to 300,000 rupiah (US$16 to US$19). But observers believe prices will likely go up with time.\n\n\"Ensuring that the price is affordable is important, but at the same time, the operator also has to ensure cost recovery because this project is quite expensive,\" said Dr Negara.\n\n\"While initially a lot of people are sceptical that this project will be completed, eventually even with some delays, it has been completed. So I think this is a good sign for both countries to further their bilateral cooperation,\" said Dr Negara.\n\"But I think Indonesia also needs to diversify its infrastructure investment source, not just rely on China, and also look at other alternatives, given that there are so many big projects.\"\nThe rail deal was signed in October 2015 after Indonesia selected China over Japan in a fierce bidding.\n\"China did not require a state guarantee, Japan did. So China gave a more attractive option,\" said Mr Achmad, adding that while Indonesia is sliding towards Chinese investment, it is not entirely dependent on China.\n\"Why is Indonesia welcoming Chinese investment? Because China delivers, when others do not. But at the same time, there are healthy checks within Indonesia to avoid falling into overdependence or having the economy being dominated by a country.\"\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:T  en years ago  Xi Jinping announced the \"project of the century\", China's Belt and Road Initiative (  BRI  ).

The wind is not going to blow 24 hours a day. So we have to really work with governments, energy producers, (and) renewable energy generators to make sure the grid is set up and properly equipped to make this transition.\"\nThere is a need to encourage governments to tweak regulations, and invest in scores of renewable energy projects globally, said observers.\nFor Google, the transition also involves installing more efficient chips, using machine learning to slash power consumption, and even giving customers a chance to choose where in the world they want to run their cloud computing to meet their own sustainability goals.\n\"Customers are demanding it. Governments are demanding it. It is a business imperative that they have to become more sustainable,\" said Mr Siah.\n\"And I think a lot of companies recognise this, and I think that's why you see there's a greater push in the industry in general to have more sustainable data centres.\"\n\nOn the international front, China has been engaged in an all-encompassing competition with the United States in areas from trade and tech to security.\n\nChina's\n\nThe top leadership had already acknowledged in July that China's post-COVID economic recovery has displayed \"wave-shaped developments, and advanced with setbacks\".\nThe Politburo meeting listed challenges including domestic demand, difficulties for business to operate and \"complications and difficulties\" in the external environment.\n\"Our economy has enormous development resilience and potential. The long-term positive outlook has not changed,\" said a statement from the 24-member Politburo  the Communist Party's prime decision-making body.\nLooking forward, China's leadership has long focused on its development strategy to move away from economic growth targets and towards systemic resilience by calling for a drive for an \"internal cycle\" in the five-year plan to 2025.\nIn his work report to the 20th party congress in October, Xi laid out the top priorities as emphasising \"green\" and \"high-quality\" development, greater self-reliance and strength in science and technology, as well as improving mechanisms to promote a high-quality workforce and employment.\nChina previously included a goal to lift itself into a \"high income\" nation by 2025 and advance to a \"moderately developed\" nation by 2035, which implies income of more than US$20,000 per person. China's per capita GDP is around US$12,000, according to official data.\nAnd despite the current slump in a wide-range of economic indicators, Yu Miaojie, an economist who is also the president of Liaoning University, said he is confident that China would be able to reach its target.\n\"Right now, China's potential in being a mega-size economy and the ability to complete a full supply chain have not even been fully unleashed. With further structural reforms, it is not a problem in achieving a GDP growth of 4.5 to 5 per cent in the coming years, which would help us reach this target,\" said Yu, who is also a chair professor of economics at Peking University.\nBy 2035, China is also expected to become a \"manufacturing superpower\" and a global leader in strategically important emerging industries.\nHowever, even China's traditional role as the world's leading manufacturer, exporter and top investment destination faces challenges as geopolitical tensions grow.\nThe US and its allies are calling to de-risk their supply chains away from China to reduce reliance, while the list of export controls against Chinese companies due to security concerns has been expanded.\nWhile China's trade with  neighbouring Southeast Asian countries  and developing economies has been growing, Mexico just replaced China for the first time since 2014 as the US' biggest trading partner.\n\nChina's\ninvestment\nFor foreign investors, China's newly introduced  anti-espionage law  has spurred foreign chambers of commerce to call for clarification, potentially adding more complications for companies considering moving out of China.\nAccording to a poll published by the European Chamber of Commerce in China in June, 46 per cent of 570 companies surveyed said their \"investments begin to shift out of China as de-risking strategies emerge\".\nNeil Thomas, a Chinese politics fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute's Centre for China Analysis, said Xi faces a balancing act between economic growth and national security.\n\"Xi can still grow the economy with statist and more security-focused policies, just not as much as if he leaned further into building more open and efficient markets,\" said Thomas.\n\"To Xi Jinping, national security holds paramount importance over national and domestic security as it directly impacts his survival as a leader,\" said Lee.\nBut despite some analysts saying that Xi does not appear to be facing a crisis moment despite current challenges, China's competition with the US will now take place in direct comparison as its economic rebound has recovered better than expected.\nIn a closed-door economic academic seminar in July, Chinese economists said they were surprised to see the US recovery holding up.\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:T  HE WORLD'S  supply chains have taken a knock yet again. Russia's invasion of Ukraine provoked the biggest commodity shock since 1973, and one of the worst disruptions to wheat supplies in a century. Countries from Hungary to Indonesia are banning food exports to ensure supply at home. The West has issued sanctions against Russia, depriving it of all sorts of parts and technologies.\nThe strain on globalisation comes on top of the effects of the financial crisis of 2007-09, Brexit, President Donald Trump and the pandemic. For years measures of global integration have gone south. Between 2008 and 2019 world trade, relative to global  GDP  , fell by about five percentage points. Tariffs and other barriers to trade are piling up. Global flows of long-term investment fell by half between 2016 and 2019. Immigration is lower too, and not just because of border closures.\nThe war in Ukraine stands to accelerate another profound shift in global trade flows, by pitting large autocracies against liberal democracies. Such confrontation happened during the cold war, too. But this time autocracies are bigger, richer and more technologically sophisticated. Their share in global output, trade and innovation has risen, and they are key links in many supply chains. Attempts to drift apart, therefore, will bring new consequences, and costs, for the world economy.\nAfter the second world war democracies ruled the economic roost. In 1960 America, Britain, Canada, France, Italy and Japan accounted for about 40% of global exports. Autocracies, by contrast, were economically unimportant on the world stage. The Soviet Union accounted for 4% of global trade; China barely featured in the statistics. Average  GDP  per head across the communist bloc was a tenth of America's. The West was locked in a fierce ideological battle with communist countries, filled with proxy wars and nuclear scares. But in economic terms there was no contest.\nTheir economies were also largely unintegrated. One observer in the late 1950s reckoned that trade between the  USSR  and America was so small that a big shipment could double the total from one month to another. The exceptions in east-west tradea bit of Russian gas to Europe; a wheat deal in 1972; a vodka-for-Pepsi swap from 1974were few. A study published by the  IMF  days before the Soviet Union fell said that \"foreign direct investment in the  USSR  has been minimal to date\".\nThe communist bloc played by its own rules. Soviet external economic activity largely took place within  COMECON  , a group of sympathetic countries (China and the  USSR  barely traded with each other from the late 1950s, having fallen out). Trade in  COMECON  took place not via money-for-stuff, but in the form of a peculiar system of barteroil for manufactured goods, sayagreed by governments.\nFrom the late 1970s onwards, autocratic regimes began to open up. In part this was the result of an ideological change, first apparent in China. The death of Chairman Mao in 1976 allowed hitherto heretical views to emerge. \"Unless it could expand and modernise its economy more rapidly than it had done in previous decades, China would remain poor, weak and vulnerable,\" wrote Aaron Friedberg of Princeton University in a paper published in 2018, describing the ideas of Deng Xiaoping, the leader who spearheaded China's opening up in the 1980s. A focus on class struggle gave way to a desire for modernisation and development. Further momentum for globalisation came from the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.\nThe West, on the whole, welcomed and encouraged economic liberalisation, believing that it could be a force for good (and for large profits). By bringing countries into the global trading system it would be possible to raise living standards, as well as foster democracy and freedom. A globalised world would also be a more peaceful one, the argument went.\nIn the 1990s globalisation took off. Trade boomed. Annual global flows of foreign direct investment (  FDI  , including purchases of companies and the construction of new factories) rose by a factor of six. In 1990 Russia's first McDonald's opened, in Moscow;  KFC  set up shop a few years later. Russian oil companies began directing their exports towards the West. Between 1985 and 2015 Chinese goods exports to America rose by a factor of 125.\nLiving standards certainly went up. The number of people living in extreme poverty has fallen by 60% since 1990. Some formerly closed countries have utterly changed. The average Estonian is now only marginally poorer than the average Italian.\nThe other hoped-for benefit of globalisationpolitical liberalisationhas faltered, however. Our World in Data, a research organisation, puts countries into four groups, ranging from most to least free: \"liberal democracies\", such as America and Japan; more flawed \"electoral democracies\", such as Poland and Sri Lanka; \"electoral autocracies\", such as Turkey and Hungary; and \"closed autocracies\", such as China and Vietnam, where citizens have no real choice over their leader.\nClassifying political regimes is not an exact science, and involves making assumptions and judgments. Our World In Data counts India as an electoral autocracy since 2019, for instance, which some other sources do not agree with. Nonetheless, it helps give an idea of a broader trend: the waning might of liberal democracies.\nThe share of political regimes that were liberal democracies rose from 11% in 1970 to 23% in 2010. But democracy has retrenched since. Most of the 1.9bn people living in closed autocracies now reside in just one country: China. But lesser forms of autocracy are on the rise, such as in Turkey, where President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has consolidated power during his two decades in office (see chart 1).\nUsing data from the World Bank, the  IMF  and elsewhere, we divide the global economy into two. We estimate that today the autocratic world (ie, closed and electoral autocracies) accounts for over 30% of global  GDP  , more than double its share at the end of the cold war. Its share of global exports has soared over that period. The combined market value of its listed firms represented just 3% of the global total in 1989. Now it represents 30% (see chart 2).\nChina is by far the biggest non-democracy in economic terms, with a dollar  GDP  roughly two-thirds of America's, making up over half of our group of autocracies. But others, such as Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Vietnam, have also gained in economic clout over the past 30 years.\nAutocracies are now an especially serious rival to democracies when it comes to investment and innovation. In 2020 their governments and firms invested $9trn in everything from machinery and equipment to the construction of roads and railways. Democracies invested $12trn. Autocracies received more  FDI  than democracies between 2018 and 2020. And since the mid-1990s their share of patent applications has gone from 5% to over 60%. China dominates patenting, but on almost all our other measures the economic power of autocracies has soared even after China is excluded from our calculations.\nMany autocracies have remained steadfastly mercantilist. China, for instance, opened its domestic markets where it suited it, but kept whole sectors closed off to allow domestic champions to rise. Nonetheless autocracies have become integrated with democracies to an extent that would have been unthinkable during the cold war. Vietnam, which has been ruled by a single party for decades, for instance, has become a pivotal link in the global manufacturing supply chain. The kingdoms and emirates of the Middle East are vital sources of oil and gas.\nWe estimate that roughly one-third of democracies' goods imports come from other political regimes. The codependency in some markets is clear. Democracies produce about two-thirds of the oil necessary to meet their daily needs. The rest must come from somewhere else. Half of the coffee that fills Europeans' cups comes from places where people have weak political rights. And that is before getting to precious metals and rare earths.\nIntegration goes far beyond trade. American multinationals employ 3m people outside democracies, a rise of 90% in the past decade (their total foreign employment has increased by a third). Investors from democracies hold over a third of the autocratic world's total stock of inward  FDI  . Autocracies have built up huge foreign reserves, now worth more than $7trn and often denominated in \"free\" currencies like the dollar and the euro.\n\nBROKEN DREAM\nThis intimacy is now under threat as a third, darker period comes into view. Even before the war in Ukraine, powerful countries were losing interest in a truly global presence. Instead they were seeking to rely more on themselves or to dominate their immediate geographical area. Their new thinking is becoming increasingly enshrined in strategy and policy.\nThe waning appetite for globalisation has a few causes. One relates to greater consumer awareness in the West about human-rights abuses in places such as China and Vietnam. Polls in Western countries regularly find that a high share of respondents support boycotting Chinese goods (whether they would actually do so is another matter). Western companies are being pressed to source goods elsewhere. Concerns over the national-security implications of trade and investment, including industrial espionage, have also risen.\nAutocracies have their own worries. One is that too much integration can cause Western culture to seep across borders, weakening autocratic rule. Deng himself identified the dilemma: \"If you open the window for fresh air, you have to expect some flies to blow in.\"\nAnother, bigger worry relates to power. Being part of global supply chains means being vulnerable to sanctions. This was clear from an early stage. In 1989 China faced sanctions after the crackdown in Tiananmen Square. The next year America placed Cuba, El Salvador, Jordan, Kenya, Romania and Yemen under sanctions for various infractions. Several rounds of Western sanctions on Russia, first in 2014 and then again today, bring the message home still more forcefully.\nAlready there is evidence of a crude decoupling. In 2014 America banned Huawei, a Chinese tech firm, from bidding on American government contracts. In 2018 Mr Trump started a trade war with China, with the goal of forcing it to make changes to what America said were \"unfair trade practices\", including the theft of intellectual property.  FDI  flows between China and America are now just $5bn a year, down from nearly $30bn five years ago.\nRecent policy announcements and trade deals shed some light on the probable direction of globalisation as the world's most powerful democracies and autocracies turn away from each other. Countries are signing smaller, regional trade deals instead; democracies are banding together, as are autocracies; and many countries are also seeking greater self-reliance.\nBegin with regional trade deals, the number of which is booming. In 2020 China signed an agreement with 14 other Asian countries, mostly non-democracies. In that year the  ASEAN  group of South-East Asian countries became China's biggest trading partner, replacing the  EU  . In Africa, meanwhile, most countries have ratified the African Continental Free Trade Area.\nCountries with shared political systems are also coming closer. The CoRe Partnership, an agreement between America and Japan, launched last year and is designed to promote co-operation in new technologies from mobile networks to biotech. The  US  -  EU  Trade and Technology Council, the pointed ambition of which is to promote \"the spread of democratic, market-oriented values\", is working on climate change and strengthening supply chains.\nAutocracies are also forming their own blocs. The stock of long-term investment from the autocratic world into China rose by over a fifth in 2020, even as the amount of investment from autocracies into America barely budged. Saudi Arabia is reportedly mulling selling oil to China in yuan, rather than dollars. Long-term investment from autocracies into increasingly illiberal India rose by 29% in 2020.\nLarge countries in particular, meanwhile, are also turning inward. A big focus of President Joe Biden's administration, for instance, is \"supply-chain resilience\", which in part involves efforts to encourage domestic production. China's turn in 2020 towards a \"dual circulation\" strategy includes an attempt to rely less on global suppliers. It wants to release its rivals' grip on \"chokehold\" industries, such as chipmaking equipment, which it fears could be used to strangle its rise. India, too, has turned towards self-reliance.\nMany of these efforts could come at a price. Autocracies are notoriously prone to pursuing their own self-interests, rather than banding together. History shows that withdrawing from global trade and investment networks carries huge costs. In 1808 America came close to autarky as a result of a self-imposed embargo on international shipping. Research by Douglas Irwin of Dartmouth College suggests that the ban cost about 8% of America's gross national product. More recently, many studies have found that it was primarily American firms that paid for Mr Trump's tariffs. Brexit has slowed growth and investment in Britain.\nRussia's attempt at self-reliance, by pursuing import substitution on a large scale, building up foreign-exchange reserves and developing parallel technological networks, shows just how hard it is to cut yourself off from the global economy.  Sanctions  by the West rendered much of its reserves useless overnight. The economy was struggling even before the war, and has since gone off a cliff. Unemployment is likely to soar as foreign firms leave the country.\nThe risk, though, is that countries draw the opposite lesson from Russia: that less integration, rather than more, is the best way to protect themselves from economic pain. The world would become more fractured and mutually suspiciousnot to mention poorer than it could have been.  \nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, business and markets,  sign up to Money Talks  , our weekly newsletter.\nRead more of our recent coverage of the  Ukraine crisis\n\nW  ho are  the earliest adopters of new technologies? Cutting-edge stuff tends to be expensive, meaning the answer is often the extremely rich. Early adopters also tend to be incentivised by cut-throat competition to look beyond the status quo. As such, there may be no group more likely to pick up new tools than the uber-rich and hyper-competitive hedge-fund industry.\nThis rule appears to hold for artificial intelligence (  ai  ) and machine learning, which were first employed by hedge funds decades ago, well before the recent hype. First came the \"quants\", or quantitative investors, who use data and algorithms to pick stocks and place short-term bets on which assets will rise and fall. Two Sigma, a quant fund in New York, has been experimenting with these techniques since its founding in 2001. Man Group, a British outfit with a big quant arm, launched its first machine-learning fund in 2014.  aqr  Capital Management, from Greenwich, Connecticut, began using  ai  at around the same time. Then came the rest of the industry. The hedge funds' experience demonstrates  ai  's ability to revolutionise businessbut also shows that it takes time to do so, and that progress can be interrupted.\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:Southeast Asian countries are drawing up governance and ethics guidelines for artificial intelligence (AI) that will impose \"guardrails\" on the booming technology, five officials with direct knowledge of the matter said.\nRegulators across the world are rushing to draft regulations to govern the use of generative AI, which can create text and images and is engendering excitement as well as fear about its potential to reshape a wide range of industries.\n\nThe US has established its first generative artificial intelligence task force, the Pentagon announced on Thursday, amid fierce competition with China in the domain that is vital to future warfare.\nTask Force Lima  , as it is called, will assess, synchronise and employ generative AI capabilities across the Defence Department, ensuring that it remains at the forefront of cutting-edge technologies while safeguarding national security, according to a Pentagon statement.\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:SINGAPORE: Singapore is exploring \"new tools\" to \"manage significant investments into critical entities\", said Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong on Monday (Aug 28).\nThe minister, who was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of his ministry's annual economic dialogue, did not elaborate on what these new tools or critical entities would be.\nHe said the new move comes as Singapore faces \"significant challenges\" in the global economy and there is a need to strengthen the country's position as \"a trusted hub for businesses to invest with confidence\".\n\"To do that, we will need to make sure that investments into critical entities do not affect Singapore's economic resilience and our national security interest,\" said Mr Gan.\n\"That is why (the) Ministry of Trade and Industry is exploring new tools to allow us to manage significant investments into critical entities.\"\nMr Gan added that many countries around the world are already doing so.\nMoving forward, his ministry will engage \"industries to better understand their  perspectives and to work with them to minimise the impact on businesses and investments\".\nSeveral countries have in recent years introduced or strengthened measures to subject investments in strategically important sectors or companies to greater scrutiny.\nIn the UK, the National Security and Investment Act, which came into force in January last year, allows the UK government to block or impose remedies on investments deemed to pose a national security risk.\nMore recently, Germany has said it  wants to tighten the process for reviewing foreign investments  with a new law that would aim to enhance economic security, according to a Reuters report.\nWithin Asia, China prohibits or restricts foreign investments in certain sectors listed on a \"negative list\" under its Foreign Investment Law. These sectors where foreign investments are off-limits include nuclear power plants, publishing and telecom.\nEarlier at the dialogue session, Mr Gan delivered a speech where he touched on the global challenges confronting Singapore.\n\"We exited the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic earlier this year, but we have stepped into a rather unstable and unpredictable environment. New challenges have emerged and in some instances, are intensifying,\" he said.\nThese include slower global growth amid monetary policy tightening worldwide to combat inflation, the multilateral open trading system coming under pressure, the rise of new technology such as generative artificial intelligence (AI) that has disrupted industries and businesses, as well as climate change.\nHowever, these \"daunting\" challenges can also present opportunities for Singapore, the minister said.\nSingapore, for one, can continue to distinguish itself as \"a trusted and reliable trading partner\". The emergence of new technologies and the net zero transition also serve up opportunities to grow the country's digital and green economy, respectively.\nEfforts to capitalise on these opportunities are underway, said Mr Gan, pointing to the  Singapore Economy 2023 vision  announced last year. This vision comprises strategies to achieve long-term growth by expanding trade, growing the manufacturing and services industries, as well as uplifting enterprises and workers.\nMore can be done and these include having an agile workforce and strengthening Singapore's economic connectivity to new markets and appeal as a business hub, the minister said.\n\"Singapore must resist the pressure to turn inward and become more protectionist,\" Mr Gan said. \"We have always earned our living by remaining open, expanding our economic space, and staying connected to the world.\"\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:KUALA LUMPUR: For quite a while now, pilot Mohd Radzi Desa, 58, has been planning on getting an electric vehicle (EV) as his next car.\n\nPOSITIVE POLICIES ATTRACT INVESTORS\nIn August, EP Manufacturing Berhad  a local auto parts manufacturer  signed a memorandum of understanding with BAIC Motor Corporation Ltd - one of China's largest automobile groups - to develop local production of vehicles including EVs in Malaysia.\nChinese automaker Geely - which holds a 49.9 per cent stake in Malaysian manufacturer Proton - meanwhile will invest RM30 billion in the development and commercialisation of the Automotive High-Tech Valley (AHTV) in Tanjung Malim, Perak with a focus on EV.\nBut Mr Shahrol Halmi, the co-founder of the Malaysia Electric Vehicles Owners Club (MyEVOC) told CNA that Tesla's moves made the biggest news on EVs because many were surprised by how \"affordable\" it was in relation to other brands.\n\"It is very big news. BYD was a hot seller when it was launched earlier this year at RM170,000 but you don't need to top up much more to get a Tesla model Y while a comparable BMW i4 is substantially higher in price,\" he said.\nThere are more than 40 models of EVs currently being sold in the Malaysian market.\nBesides Tesla, they include models from newer brands in the Malaysian market such as BYD, Ora and Neta from China as well as BMW, Volvo, Mercedes, Hyundai and even Rolls Royce.\nMr Shahrol believes Malaysia's EV push began when the government approved the Low Carbon Mobility Blueprint (LCMB) in Oct 2021, a policy framework that sought to reduce emissions from the transportation sector, ranked as the second-largest emitter of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) after the energy sector.\nDuring the 2022 Budget, the government announced full exemption from import and excise duties as well as sales tax for EVs, road tax exemption for EVs, and income tax reliefs for the purchase of charging facilities.\nThe government this year then extended import duty exemptions for components for the local assembly of EVs, the excise duty and sales tax exemptions for locally assembled completely knocked down (CKD) EVs to 2027, as well as the import and excise duty exemptions on imported completely built-up (CBU) units to 2025.\nCBU refers to cars that are imported while CKDs are cars manufactured in the country.\nEV users also don't have to pay road tax until 2025.\nMr Jigar Shah, head of sustainability sesearch of Maybank Investment Banking Group, told CNA that the entry of Tesla and the investment proposed by Geely in the EV sector in Malaysia are positive reflections of the recent policies set by the government.\n\"Malaysia is setting prudent and proactive policies to benefit from the coming boom in the EV sector especially by attracting investment from Tesla and announcing a massive increase in share of renewables in the next two to three decades,\" he said.\nMr Jigar pointed out that local Malaysian companies such as Petronas and Yinson are also setting up charging stations, which will be critical as consumers shift to EV from traditional Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles that run on fossil fuels such as petrol or diesel.\nHe also said that a recent government decision to significantly increase the share of renewables to 70 per cent in the total energy mix by 2050 was very positive for the EV sector as well.\nHe added that Malaysia is the third largest car market within ASEAN behind Indonesia and Thailand, and its per capita transport emissions are higher than the world average,\n\"These developments augur well for the country to scale up fast and transition the entire ICE vehicle sector to electric in the next 10 to 15 years,\" Mr Jigar said, adding that Malaysia has an opportunity to develop an EV manufacturing base and ecosystem for the local and export markets.\nMalaysia has targeted 15 per cent of total industry volume (TIV) to be contributed by EV and hybrid vehicles by 2030 and 38 per cent of TIV by 2040.\nRakuten Trade head of equity sales Vincent Lau told CNA that recent developments in the Malaysian EV sector are significantly shaping its growth prospects, saying that brands such as BYD and Ota are offering EVs that are more \"affordable\".\n\"It is still too early to say that Malaysia can be an EV powerhouse, but they are on the right track with the policies that are in place,\" he said.\nIn 2022, EV sales in Malaysia totalled 2,631 while the year before it was 271 sales.\nBMI, a Fitch Solutions company forecasted in a commentary on Aug 24 that Malaysia's total EV sales will quadruple this year, although the EV penetration rate in the country would be at just 1.8 per cent.\n\nLONG ROAD AHEAD FOR EV PRODUCTION IN MALAYSIA\nMr Shahrol of MyEvoc said that in terms of manufacturing EVs, Malaysia still lags the likes of Thailand who are the leading market of EVs in the region.\nAccording to a report by the Nation, Thailand manufactured 92,746 EVs in 2022, an increase of about 38 per cent compared to the previous year. Altogether Thailand was reported to have assembled 1.9 million vehicles last year.\nOther countries in Southeast Asia that are making a push to attract investors in the EV industry include Indonesia and Vietnam.\nThe Indonesian government has targeted EVs to make up one-fifth of all domestically manufactured vehicles by 2025 while Vietnam's own manufacturer VinFast is now focusing only on EVs.\n\"From the government perspective, manufacturing provides jobs, especially as EVs are geared towards integration of software and high technology. We can understand why it is a new frontier the government is keen to get a head start in,\" said Mr Shahrol.\nAccording to the International Energy Association (IEA), global sales of electric cars are set to grow by 35 per cent this year, expanding its share of the overall car market to 18 per cent.\nIndustry players say this is why countries including Malaysia are aggressively pushing for investments for EV investments.\nCurrently, only Volvo and Mercedes are assembling EVs in Malaysia.\nMr Charles Frump, managing director of Volvo Car Malaysia, told CNA that the increased interest and investments by automotive firms in Malaysia's EV sector signals a promising future for the country's automotive industry.\nHe said that the company is aiming for 50 per cent of their global sales to be fully electric cars by 2025, and for all new cars to be fully electric by 2030.\nVolvo was the first to assemble an EV in Malaysia - its XC40 SUV model - at its plant in Shah Alam, Selangor since last year.\nHe added that Malaysia is now Volvo Cars' regional hub, exporting EVs to neighbouring countries such as Indonesia, Taiwan, Thailand, Philippines, and Vietnam.\n\"The increased interest and investments by automotive firms in Malaysia's EV sector signals a promising future for the country's automotive industry,\" Mr Frump said, in an emailed response to queries by CNA on the EV industry in Malaysia.\n\"With Government support for EV infrastructure and with the surge of traditional and new brands entering the local EV space, we are seeing an affirmation of our electrification ambitions and a growing interest for local EV adoption in the coming years.\"\nAccording to the BMI report, Mercedes has indicated that it plans to have 30 percent of all its vehicles sold in Malaysia electrified by 2030, as the country offers one of the highest EV penetration rates for its products globally.\nMalaysia's International Trade and Industry Minister Tengku Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz had said in July that as the EV industry is relatively new to Malaysia, many investors, both local and foreign, are still waiting for \"certainties\" in the market before making any investment decision.\n\nBut President Xi Jinping is not leaving China's technological fate up to the markets. Technological progress is a centrepiece of national policy embedded in the 14th Five-Year Plan. Whereas in the past a government minister would have been responsible for managing this process, Xi is overseeing it directly. As part of this initiative, the government is showering Chinese tech firms with land, cash and contracts. And it is building an innovation ecosystem modelled after the Manhattan Project and NASA's Apollo program, with a fully integrated incubation chain linking national labs, universities and high-tech \"science parks\".\nChina's government plans to build ten national research labs, each with a different focus  for example, an artificial intelligence lab in Shanghai and a quantum computing lab in Hefei  and supervised directly by a member of the Standing Committee, the Communist Party of China's top decision-making body.\nMoreover, the authorities aim to create 100 new tech centres and 100 additional high-tech industrial parks around the country and have introduced an accelerated process for initial public offerings, delivered through the new Shanghai Stock Exchange Science and Technology Innovation Board (also known as the STAR Market).\nLocal governments also have a crucial role to play in this process. And, already, many  are being innovative about how they support technological development.\nMany local governments  such as in Shanghai, Chengdu, Hefei and Chongqing  have embraced fund-of-funds structures and begun securing large stakes in ventures. The Shanghai government collaborated with Tesla, and the Anhui government secured a stake in the Chinese electric-vehicle company Nio.\nBy encouraging venture capitalists to bring potential \"unicorns\" to their regions, local governments position themselves to get credit for the resulting GDP growth, job creation and innovation. China has already attracted thousands from around the world to fill research-related positions  .\n\nBILLIONS POURING INTO SUBSIDISING INNOVATION\nTo be sure, over the last two years, China's central government has taken sweeping action to regulate and rein in tech giants in the name of antitrust, social equity and data protection. But, contrary to popular belief, this campaign does not contradict, let alone undermine, the goal of achieving global technological supremacy.\nIn the long run, appropriate regulation will pave the way for high-tech companies' robust growth on a level playing field.\nThe regulatory clampdown has targeted consumer-facing internet-platform companies, including Alibaba, Didi and JD.com. None operates in the cutting-edge areas  such as biotech, quantum computing, artificial intelligence and semiconductors  where China hopes to catch up to the US.\nCurbing their growth will not only boost competition in the sectors where they do operate; it might also free up resources, which could be redirected to the technological frontier.\nIn any case, the  juguo  system means that national resources can be mobilised and allocated without tallying the cost. This means the equivalent of billions  maybe trillions  of dollars will go toward subsidising innovation, from supporting basic research to building science parks.\nThe effort will inevitably waste resources. But China's leaders are confident that, in the long term, it will pay off.\nThat kind of thinking is the main advantage of a state-led strategy. Innovation is a highly uncertain process, fraught with risk. Left to their own devices, private firms often prioritise short-term gains over opportunities to invest in innovation and develop core competencies.\nChina's government, however, has the tools, patience and determination to bring about long-term transformation, regardless of the short-term costs. The state will pay to cast a wide net in return for a big catch.\n\nCHINA MUST DO MORE FOR REAL TECH BREAKTHROUGHS\nThis strategy may help China accelerate its mastery of high-tech products, but to make real technological breakthroughs, the country needs a much more open education system.\nIt also must create an innovation process in which people are motivated both by market rewards and an intrinsic desire to advance knowledge.\nChina's old \"short, flat, fast\" investment strategy, which has worked for sports and infrastructure, must give way to a new playbook for technology, adopted by a patient country with patient people and patient capital.\nOne thing is clear: Given the Chinese response to US pressure on its tech giants, it is safe to assume that further restrictions will only strengthen China's determination to achieve technological self-sufficiency  and, eventually, global primacy. This should provide the Biden administration with some food for thought as it considers its next steps.\nKeyu Jin is a Professor of Economics at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

Expansion was largely driven by increased industrial production in emerging markets, which account for 60% of shipped exports. Rising trade was accompanied by a 3.3% increase in maritime-fleet capacity. UNCTAD thinks the prospects are bright, too. Autonomous ships could boost efficiency in the industry, though job losses and cyber-security concerns may slow adoption of the technology. Despite tensions between America and China, seaborne trade is forecast to rise by another 4% in 2018, and then by 3.8% annually until 2023.\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:China's fast growing digital economy is reshaping its economic structure, job market, tax and welfare system, but it will bring planning challenges if laws and lawmakers are slow to catch up, officials and analysts say.\nWith China's  digital economy  poised to be the nation's major driver of growth in coming years, the government is being urged to rethink the way it calculates key economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (GDP) and the unemployment rate, while researching how the welfare system has been changed by the growing use of digital platforms.\n\nTop Chinese communist party officials, including vice premier Liu He and No 4 party ranking member Wang Yang, met Big Tech leaders on Tuesday to encourage them to play a constructive role in the national economy, sending a signal of support to the Chinese tech sector after 18 months of regulatory crackdowns.\nThe Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the country's top political advisory body, held a special symposium on Tuesday to promote the digital economy, confirming earlier reports by the  South China Morning Post  that Beijing wants to give the tech sector a lift as economic growth falters amid Covid-19 lockdowns.\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:The World Economic Forum's 2020 Future of Jobs Report predicts that many private companies will employ machines and algorithms more broadly than ever, hindering employment prospects across sectors and regions. AI, robots, and other new technologies could threaten 15 per cent of the average company's workforce as soon as 2025.\nDEEP DIVIDES, UNEVEN RECOVERY\nGiven such effects, the digital transformation could widen social and economic disparities and expand the wage gap between digitally skilled and unskilled workers.\nThere is already a deep divide between socioeconomic groups and across regions when it comes to access to new digital technologies, and technological diffusion will be uneven across firms and industries as well. Small companies may have less capacity to adopt new innovations than larger ones, which in turn may try to block new competitors from entering the market.\nMore broadly, it could take some time for the digital revolution to drive economy-wide productivity growth. Economists have long observed the \"paradox\" that the impact of information and communication technologies shows up \"everywhere but in the productivity statistics.\"\nNow that the pandemic has widened the productivity gap across firms and industries, traditional companies and small businesses may be slow to recover, while the tech giants flourish under conditions of heightened digital demand.\nCONCERNS OVER PRIVACY\nThe digital revolution also raises political concerns, such as when governments and corporations misuse data and technology.\nDuring the COVID-19 outbreak, some East Asian countries used contact-tracing apps, mobility data, cameras, and other digital technologies to contain the virus, but this surveillance often came at the expense of privacy.\nWith the tech giants wielding such massive power through their command of user data, consumers are becoming more aware of the importance of data security and privacy protections.\nAddressing such questions is essential to preparing for the post-pandemic era, when all countries will need to embrace new ways of working, producing and consuming.\nDigitalisation can make a huge contribution to public health, the environment, consumer welfare, and wealth creation across society, but only if the public and private sectors work together to ensure inclusiveness.\nMost countries will need policies to narrow the gaps in digital skills and access, because a growing share of jobs will require more technological know-how.\nEducation systems must do more to equip students with the knowledge and skills they will need in a digital future. And job training must keep all workers up to date on the latest digital technologies.\nGOVERNMENTS' BIG ROLE\nGovernments have a critical role to play on all of these fronts. It was state support and commitments that brought us revolutionary innovations like the Internet, antibiotics, renewable energy, and the mRNA technology behind the development of the most effective COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:The  debate over copyright has been seen  around the world, with some artists angered by AI copying the styles they have sacrificed years to develop, often without consent or compensation. This has sparked questions of intellectual property ownership and legal challenges in countries like the US.\nBut this is only one of the ground-up fears that AI has brought on. Some are worried about losing their jobs, while others say the technology could be used for nefarious purposes.\nAI systems used in recruitment and judicial processes  also risk perpetuating biases  , as the training data they use could be encoded with socio-economic, racial, religious and gender prejudices, experts say.\nAt the same time, the potential of using AI to do good is also there - from driving automation to predicting illness.\nAgainst this backdrop, a  race for AI regulation is taking place  to avert the risks while hopefully reaping the rewards - with action being taken at the global, regional and national levels.\nAn international milestone was logged just a month ago. The first-ever AI Safety Summit, held in the UK on Nov 1, saw the US and China coming together with more than 25 other countries to affirm the safe and responsible use of AI.\nThe landmark agreement also places \"strong responsibility\" on developers of frontier AI to test their systems for safety.\nFrontier AI often refers to the first wave of mainstream AI applications like ChatGPT.\nOn a regional scale, the European Union is in the  final stages of formulating its AI Act  , a far-reaching law that would classify AI systems by risk and mandate various development and use requirements.\nCloser to home, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is planning to  draw up governance and ethics guidelines  for AI, which analysts told CNA are expected to suggest \"safeguards\" that can mitigate identified risks.\nWhile the guide is not expected to translate into regional legislation, it could spur individual member states to create new laws or tweak existing ones to regulate the technology, they added.\nCountries behind the AI curve will also get a leg up as they can benefit from the sharing of knowledge.\n\"The public  should care about AI regulation  because the technology is more pervasive than we normally think,\" said Dr Karryl Sagun-Trajano, a research fellow for future issues and technology at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), pointing out that AI is used in sectors like healthcare, education, transport and crime fighting.\n\nIS AI COMING FOR YOUR JOB?\nThe potential for AI to upend the labour market and disrupt industries has been much discussed. A Goldman Sachs report predicts that as many as 300 million jobs could be impacted by AI automation.\nObservers have warned that faster, smarter and cheaper AI-powered chatbots could replace outsourced call centres handling customer service for many companies.\nThis is especially stark for countries like India and the Philippines, where call centres provide modest-paying work and surveys have shown automation could render over a million jobs obsolete.\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:T  he age  of  \"generative\" artificial intelligence  has well and truly arrived. Open  ai  's chatbots, which use large-language-model (  llm  ) technology, got the ball rolling in November. Now barely a day goes by without some  mind-blowing advance  . An  ai  -powered song featuring a fake \"Drake\" and \"The Weeknd\" recently shook the music industry. Programs which convert text to video are making fairly convincing content. Before long consumer products such as Expedia, Instacart and OpenTable will plug into Open  ai  's bots, allowing people to order food or book a holiday by typing text into a box. A recently leaked presentation, reportedly from a Google engineer, suggests the tech giant is worried about how easy it is for rivals to make progress. There is more to comeprobably a lot more.\nThe development of  ai  raises profound questions. Perhaps most pressing, though, is a straightforward one. What does this mean for the economy? Many have grand expectations. New research by Goldman Sachs, a bank, suggests that \"widespread  ai  adoption could eventually drive a 7% or almost $7trn increase in annual global  gdp  over a ten-year period.\" Academic studies point to a three-percentage-point rise in annual labour-productivity growth in firms that adopt the technology, which would represent a huge uplift in incomes compounded over many years. A study published in 2021 by Tom Davidson of Open Philanthropy, a grantmaking outfit, puts a more than 10% chance on \"explosive growth\"defined as increases in global output of more than 30% a yearsometime this century. A few economists, only half-jokingly, hold out the possibility of global incomes becoming infinite.\n\nI  t can take  a little imagination to see how some innovations might change an economy. Not so with the latest  ai  tools  . It is easyfrom a writer's perspective, uncomfortably soto think of contexts in which something like Chat  gpt  , a clever chatbot which has taken the web by storm since its release in November, could either dramatically boost a human worker's productivity or replace them outright. The  gpt  in its name stands for \"generative pre-trained transformer\", which is a particular kind of language model. It might well stand for general-purpose technology: an earth-shaking sort of innovation which stands to boost productivity across a wide-range of industries and occupations, in the manner of steam engines, electricity and computing. The economic revolutions powered by those earlier  gpt  s can give us some idea how powerful  ai  might transform economies in the years ahead.\nIn a paper published in 1995, Timothy Bresnahan of Stanford University and Manuel Trajtenberg of Tel Aviv University set out what they saw as the characteristics of a general-purpose technology. It must be used in many industries, have an inherent potential for continued improvement and give rise to \"innovational complementarities\"that is, induce knock-on innovation in the industries which use it.  ai  is being adopted widely, seems to get better  by the day  and is being deployed in ever more  r  &  d  contexts. So when does the economic revolution begin?\n\nI  F YOU LISTEN  to the bombast in Beijing and Washington,  America and China  are engaged in an all-out contest for technological supremacy. \"Fundamentally, we believe that a select few technologies are set to play an outsized importance over the coming decade,\" declared Jake Sullivan, President Joe Biden's national security adviser, last September. In February Xi Jinping, China's paramount leader, echoed the sentiment, stating that \"we urgently need to strengthen basic research and solve key technology problems\" in order to \"cope with international science and technology competition, achieve a high level of self-reliance and self-improvement\".\nNo technology seems to obsess policymakers on both sides of the Pacific more right now than  artificial intelligence  (  AI  ). The rapid improvements in the abilities of \"generative\"  AI  s like  Chat  GPT  , which analyse the web's worth of human text, images or sounds and can then create increasingly passable simulacrums, have only strengthened the obsession. If generative  AI  proves as transformational as its boosters claim, the technology could give those who wield it an economic and military edge in the 21st century's chief geopolitical contest. Western and Chinese strategists already talk of an  AI  arms race. Can China win it?\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:In a public toilet next to Beijing's Temple of Heaven, it is reported that a toilet paper dispenser uses surveillance cameras to check on people stealing toilet paper.\nAt Peking University, a lecturer uses surveillance cameras to check whether students are bored.\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:The last two years have been ones of intense disruption. The coronavirus has interrupted all aspects of life, from regular social gatherings to supply chain logistics. It is no exaggeration to say the pandemic has changed the world. But while limits on the number of customers dining together at a restaurant table ease, other changes are likely to be more permanent.\nEducation is one sector unlikely to go back to the old ways. Distance learning already existed pre-pandemic but it has greatly expanded in the last two years and the introduction of new technologies has accelerated during the same period. The workplace, too, looks to have irrevocably changed, with online meetings now a part of the new normal and work from home an accepted part of many company cultures.\n\nWidespread lockdowns and border closures to combat the Covid-19 pandemic have interrupted supply chains and largely paralysed the global economy. Yet its real weakness is not its vulnerable production networks but souring attitudes towards globalisation  and China in particular.\nFear of China's growing economic clout is increasingly driving many foreign-trade and investment decisions, and not only in the United States. Concerns about manufacturing dependence on China have prompted calls to  reshore production  and cut the country out of supply chains. The US is even threatening  technological decoupling  .\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:INVESTMENTS ARE RISING, BUT SO ARE COSTS\nFirst, the good news. By positioning themselves as neutral parties with growing middle classes and lower labour costs, Southeast Asian economies have disproportionately benefitted as companies relocate their China investments amid growing US-China tensions. The region attracted a record US$222.5 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2022 in a post-pandemic bump.\nThis trend continued in 2023, with the US unveiling billions of dollars in investments into Vietnam shortly after upgrading their ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership, including a US$1.6 billion chip factory by Amkor.\nChina, meanwhile, invested heavily in Southeast Asia's electric vehicle (EV) sector. Carmaker BYD is building a plant in Thailand and Geely announced a US$10 billion investment to develop  Malaysia's Automotive High-Tech Valley in Perak  .\nIf only US-China competition was all about who could invest the most into the region. Their rivalry has other serious implications.\nObservers should be wary of Washington's embrace of industrial policy, or government efforts to support strategic industries by eschewing free market policies for interventionism. Even as the Inflation Reduction Act pumps over US$369 billion into the US clean energy sector, other countries might launch their own industrial policies with an arsenal of subsidies to remain competitive.\nIn a worst-case scenario, FDI might be drawn away from the region and towards markets with better subsidies.\n\nGlobal demand for these minerals is expected to surge by 400 per cent to 600 per cent in the next several decades. Any shortage would have knock-on effects on the price of these fixtures, making green transitions more expensive.\n\nA case in point is the 2022 US Commerce Department investigation into eight solar panel companies in Southeast Asia (Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia) accused of skirting US tariffs on Chinese-sourced materials.\nThat the US is heavily reliant on these four countries for photovoltaic panels  accounting for about 75 per cent on imports in 2021  was not enough to defend against bipartisan determination to crack down on \"unfair\" Chinese trade practices.\nNot only did the Commerce Department find the exporters guilty of skirting tariffs, but the US Congress voted to reinstate tariffs of up to 254 per cent on solar panels from Southeast Asia. President Joe Biden vetoed this legislative bid, but his waiver on retroactive tariffs only extends until June 2024.\nIn effect, Southeast Asian firms are caught between a rock and a hard place. They might be forced to choose between Chinese expertise and the lucrative US market, limiting their ability to grow and support their home country's green transition.\n\nNAVIGATING ROUGH WATERS, WITH HELP\nThe costs of a failed green transition are especially stark for Southeast Asia. One model by Deloitte predicted that the region could lose US$28 trillion over the next 50 years in losses from tourism, services and manufacturing if its carbon emissions are not addressed.\nWhile these challenges are steep, they are not insurmountable. There is still room to leverage the competition between the two superpowers to support the region's green transition.\n\nKevin Chen is an Associate Research Fellow with the US Programme at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.\n\n\"I feel robbed of all these experiences I could have had if it wasn't for the pandemic.\"\n\nFor 49-year-old horticulturist Tan Lin Yean, the pandemic has increased her reliance on her mobile phone, helping her embrace e-payments in the process.\nWith large crowds being a no-no during the darkest days of the pandemic, retired nurse Zainah Ibrahim, 57, has developed a disdain for such throngs.\n\n\"I also bought a bottle of disinfectant in 2020 to wipe my phone down but now I don't use it as much because it's quite troublesome,\" she said. \"Mask-wearing is more convenient and since I'm used to it, I think I'll continue doing so.\"\nSimilarly, while Ms Tan doesn't wear her mask most of the time except while taking public transport, she finds herself reaching for one in a big crowd.\n\"I subconsciously try to keep more distance away from others and put my mask on. It's really habitual now and I still need to remind myself I don't need to wear it in most settings,\" she said.\nBeyond mask-wearing and heightened awareness of hygiene among some, Singapore's healthcare system has also seen major changes that are here to stay, such as the growing prevalence of telehealth.\nAs of Nov 14, there are 178 clinics offering consultations, antigen rapid testing or both through video conferencing in Singapore, according to the Ministry of Health's (MOH) website.\nWhile using video conferencing tools for medical consultations had been piloted prior to the pandemic, Integrated Health Information Systems (IHiS) assistant chief executive Alan Goh said the crisis served as \"an impetus with accelerated adoption by both patients and providers\".\nSuch services \"enabled a lean medical team to care for a large number of COVID-19 patients, while other healthcare workers could focus on providing care to patients with more urgent care needs in the acute hospitals\" despite stretched medical resources.\n\"As Singapore transits into the COVID-19 endemic stage, we envisage that telehealth will continue to be a mainstay feature in Singapore's healthcare landscape offering greater convenience, improved accessibility to care, as well as time and cost savings for both providers and patients,\" said Mr Goh.\nPrior to COVID-19, IHiS  which is MOH's IT arm  had about 1,900 public healthcare patients using video consultations. The cumulative number jumped to more than 34,000 in 2020 and more than 120,000 in 2021.\nThe figure has continued to rise: By 2022, about 170,000 patients had sought their doctors online.\n\"We see this as an opportunity to leverage the current momentum where there is now greater comfort and familiarity among residents in using digital solutions as part of their lived experience,\" said Mr Goh.\n\"The core technology and care concepts will form the backbone behind expanded uses in areas such as virtual wards at home, and involvement of the community and social care sectors in supporting better health outcomes for our population.\"\n\n-\n\nE-COMMERCE\n\nWhile the 11.11 sales for these e-commerce platforms were much higher than a typical day, they did not disclose the total sales achieved  unlike in previous years.\n\n1\n-\n\nE-PAYMENTS\n\nEXPERTS ON WHY BEHAVIOURIAL CHANGES STICK AND OTHERS DON'T\nGiven the magnitude of COVID-19's devastation, affecting millions of lives and livelihoods around the world, it is inevitable that the pandemic caused some behavioural changes among people, experts told TODAY.\nAnd the reason why some behavioural changes have persisted, even as people learn to live with the virus, is because the benefits of adopting such changes outweigh the costs, said NUS sociologist Tan Ern Ser.\nFor example, technology has an increased presence in people's lives when it comes to shopping and work, among other things, because of its convenience, user-friendliness and time and cost savings.\nHowever, Dr Tan noted that human interaction and activities, such as verbal and non-verbal communication, cannot be fully facilitated by digital means.\n\"The positive aspects of digital use remain, when necessary, but people return to a 'new normal' which allows for multidimensional human interactions, together with the use of digital means,\" he said.\nDr Ong from Research For Impact said that at an individual level, there may not be a clear way to predict why some behaviours shift back to a pre-pandemic mode quicker than others.\n\"Individuals' own willingness to take risk, their subjective risk perceptions and the tangible or intangible costs and benefits inherent to personal circumstances all shape behaviours,\" she said.\n\"All else equal, certain people may be more willing to take certain risks and go back to their pre-pandemic behaviours more quickly than others.\"\nMs Gianna Gayle Amul, senior policy researcher and director of communications at Research For Impact, reiterated that government policies played a large role in shaping behaviours during the pandemic.\n\"At a more macro level, reversions in some behaviours can also be partly attributed to government policy, for instance, incentives that push for the return of tourism globally and rebooting the economy, not just locally but also globally,\" she said.\nWith most people in Singapore being up to date with their vaccinations or having had a COVID-19 infection at least once, there is also a degree of confidence that they would be safe from severe infection.\n\"As a global city-state, Singapore cannot afford to remain closed and be left behind when the rest of the world has decided to 'move on' from the ongoing pandemic,\" said Ms Amul.\nThis story was originally published in  TODAY  .\n\nNEW DELHI: The relationship between India and the United States has never been stronger, according to analysts, but that may be tested by a potential power shift in the US Capitol.\nIndia, like many key partners of the US, is watching the upcoming midterm elections closely, as relations between both sides are at a crucial juncture.\nThe two nations now collaborate on trade, regional security, and response to the COVID-19 pandemic, bilaterally and through forums such as the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.\nSuch cooperation means that the relationship has largely received bipartisan support in the US Capitol.\nOver the past five years, India has moved closer than before to the US.\nPresident Joe Biden's administration has pledged financial and technological support to help Delhi's transition to renewable energy by 2030.\nRecently, it also promised to fast-track visa applications for Indian workers.\nVisiting Scholar in the Asia Program at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Dr Deep Pal, noted that the White House has been looking at a presidential commission's report which talks about speeding up the process of getting green cards.\nHe added that India and the US have set aggressive deadlines in their climate change collaboration.\nBut the Republicans have openly called for tighter controls on immigration and criticised the Democrats' climate action plan  raising concerns in Delhi. These plans will \"possibly not gain as much traction\", Dr Pal said.\nThe midterm elections, which will be held on Nov 8, are the first nationwide referendum on the president's performance. Historically, the president's party tends to fare poorly and lose ground during the midterms due to voters' frustrations with current issues.\n\nUNITING AGAINST CHINA\nAccording to the US' National Defence Strategy 2022, India is at the centre of Washington's vision to counter China. The same paper states that China is the US' \"most consequential strategic competitor\".\nIndia stands to benefit with the US on this front as well, as the US is crucial for maintaining its influence and security presence in the Indo-Pacific.\nBoth countries, along with Japan and Australia, are also part of the Quad, an alliance designed to counter China's assertive actions in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nCOURTING INDIAN-AMERICAN VOTERS\nIn the US, the Republicans and the Democrats have something in common as far as India's concerned.\nBoth parties have actively reached out to the Indian-American voter base, especially since Donald Trump's presidency. Indian-Americans form just about 1 per cent of the total US population, but both sides of the chamber have been focusing their attention on this group of voters.\nThey tend to lean towards the Democrats, but that's not stopped the GOP from reaching out to them.\nThe Biden-Harris administration recently hosted an event to celebrate the Hindu festival of Diwali.\nCampaigning Republicans also held a Diwali celebration. Among them was the incumbent Texas governor Greg Abbott and former president Donald Trump, who, with an eye on presidential polls in 2024, hosted Indian-Americans at his Mar-a-Lago resort.\nAnalysts said US-India ties are an important consideration for many Indian American voters, who could make all the difference in swing states.\n\"The Indian diaspora has also been very strategic in the way they have voted on a number of issues. So, I think the issue of diaspora is front and centre, and I think there are a number of key battleground states where the diaspora has the ability to shift the balance one way or another,\" said Professor Harsh Pant, vice-president of Studies and Foreign Policy at Observer Research Foundation.\nIf the Democrats hold on to the House and Senate, analysts expect the status quo to be maintained.\nBut if Republicans take back either or both  India may have to tweak its US policy.\nThat could mean concessions on trade tariffs and looking elsewhere for partners to fight climate change, making the midterms not only crucial for the US' future but also for India's foreign policy.\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:Temasek developed its T2030 strategy in 2019 as its compass in a complex world. This blueprint emphasises agility and adaptability to thrive in a fast-changing landscape. It also aims to anticipate emerging trends with clear thinking and judgement.\n\"We live in a world characterised by volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity, and Temasek's strategy reflects the importance of staying agile and adaptable to build a resilient, forward-looking portfolio,\" said Ms Png Chin Yee, chief financial officer at Temasek. \"Our T2030 strategy is a 10-year road map that guides our strategic planning, capability-building and institutional development initiatives to help us deliver sustainable value over the long term.\"\n\nIn 30 seconds, see how Temasek's T2030 strategy tackles six top-of-mind global challenges  with the aim of fostering resilience and sustainable returns over the long term.\n\nIn 30 seconds, see how Temasek's T2030 strategy tackles six top-of-mind global challenges  with the aim of fostering resilience and sustainable returns over the long term.

ELEVATED PRICES, RESTRICTIVE MACRO POLICY, LOWER GROWTH: UNDERSTANDING THE FINANCIAL LANDSCAPE\nChallenge:  While inflation has fallen from its peak in 2022, interest rates and the cost of capital are expected to stay elevated in the near term relative to the past decade. Accordingly, macroeconomic policies remain largely restrictive compared to before 2021, which, in turn, raises the risk of lower growth, increased business costs and market volatility.\n\nApproach:  Temasek is building a diversified and forward-looking investment portfolio that can withstand economic shocks and market volatility. This portfolio has two components: A long-term resilient component that can provide stable and sustainable returns, or liquidity in the form of dividend income and distributions; and a shorter-term, dynamic component, where capital is recycled for investing in higher-growth opportunities for higher returns.\n\n\"In doing so, we want to capitalise on growth opportunities with the potential for sustainable returns above our risk-adjusted cost of capital over the long term,\" said Ms Png. \"For that, we must do three things. Firstly, maintain a very strong balance sheet. Secondly, protect the core of our portfolio by supporting the strategies of our portfolio companies and being an enabler for their success, and lastly, position our portfolio for growth.\"\n\n2. GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS & DECOUPLING IN A POST-COVID WORLD: STEERING THROUGH UNCERTAIN WATERS\nChallenge:  Shifting geopolitical dynamics can significantly impact international investments. The past decade has seen heightened tensions due to geopolitical conflicts, rivalry among the major powers, and supply chains decoupling in a post COVID-19 world.\n\nApproach:  Temasek incorporates strategic geopolitical risk assessments in its investment decisions  ensuring a pragmatic approach towards international relations. Its international policy and governance teams  located in Beijing, Brussels, Singapore and Washington DC  actively monitor geopolitical risks and consider how policy changes in key markets might affect its activities. Temasek is currently tracking the trend of decoupling and de-risking, which may disrupt global supply chains.\n\n3. TRADE AND INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS: MANAGING REGULATORY REALITIES\nChallenge:  The trade and investment regulatory environment has grown more complex as more countries adopt measures to protect national assets and critical industries. This trend is characterised by tighter trade and investment restrictions, heightened regulatory scrutiny, and greater enforcement actions. The International Monetary Fund estimates that trade restrictions will lead to global output losses of close to 2 per cent.\n\nApproach:  Temasek complies with legal and regulatory obligations across all jurisdictions it operates or invests in. The company's legal and regulatory department ensures that policies, processes and systems align with prevailing laws, and keeps abreast of regulatory developments  ensuring compliance with trade and investment, merger control, and export control regimes.\n\n\"As a global investor headquartered in Singapore, Temasek's portfolio is diversified across geographies but remains anchored in Asia,\" noted Ms Png. \"This reduces Temasek's reliance on specific markets. At the same time, we invest in companies with strong domestic demand as this can minimise the impact of trade and investment restrictions on their operations.\"\n\n4. SUSTAINABILITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE: AIMING FOR NET ZERO\nChallenge:  The transition to a net-zero world has faced setbacks due to concerns over energy security and affordability, which are partly due to the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war. This has momentarily slowed down decarbonisation efforts, even as the repercussions of climate change on economies and societies intensify.\n\nApproach:  Sustainability is at the core of everything that Temasek does. As a company, it has been carbon neutral since 2020. It has also set a target to reduce net carbon emissions from its portfolio to half its 2010 levels by 2030  aiming to reach net zero by 2050.\n\nTo achieve its goals, Temasek actively participates in the acceleration of decarbonisation efforts globally. It invests in climate-aligned opportunities in the areas of food, water, waste, energy, materials, clean transportation and the built environment, while also enabling carbon-negative solutions and encouraging decarbonisation efforts in its portfolio companies. It is also catalysing financing to accelerate the adoption of green energy and decarbonisation solutions, uplifting communities through impact investing, and forming partnerships with like-minded organisations.\n\n5. CYBER RISKS: SAFEGUARDING IN THE TECHNOLOGICAL AGE\nChallenge:  The rising threat of cyberattacks poses a substantial risk to businesses and communities. Recent cybersecurity breaches serve as a timely reminder that all companies are vulnerable to such attacks, with advancements in technologies like 5G connectivity and artificial intelligence (AI) potentially exacerbating the risk.\n\nApproach:\n\n6. INDUSTRY 4.0 AND WORKFORCE 4.0: PREPARING FOR THE FUTURE\nChallenge:  Traditional operating models are being revolutionised by the emergence of Industry 4.0  characterised by increasing automation, the employment of smart machines and the advent of human-led AI  and Workforce 4.0, which refers to a workforce that thrives in a digitally driven environment. Although Industry 4.0 has boosted economic productivity, it has also led to social challenges such as job displacements and rising inequality.\n\nApproach:\n\nExternally, Temasek supports the upskilling of employees within its portfolio companies by working with them, their unions and their workforce to understand and anticipate shifts in their respective sectors. An initiative known as the Temasek Tripartite Conversations brings together relevant government agencies, trade unions and organisations to look at the changing roles and the necessary reskilling and upskilling needs of its workers to prepare them for the jobs of the future.\n\nAnd he says the trend is being seen across the board, \"not only in our industry\".\n\"Many [firms] in the bicycle, sports equipment and clothing sectors are facing the same challenge,\" he said, \"as the inventory pressure facing European and American clients is very high.\"\nDan Digre, CEO of loudspeaker manufacturer Misco Speakers, based in the US state of Minnesota, said he had to delay shipments for four to five months due to his clients' excessive inventories. Still, he does not expect the trend to derail supply-chain adjustments.\n\"It's a tricky time now  we're not seeing supply-chain delays, but demand push-backs,\" he said, referring to customers requesting that product deliveries be postponed. \"There is no delay (in embracing) the China-plus-one model, but companies will slow production with the weak demand.\"\nThe model, as it has commonly become known, involves manufacturers staying in China, but reducing their outsized reliance on it as a production base by shifting operations elsewhere.\nDigre said his company also adjusted its supply chain to avoid punitive tariffs imposed by the US and China on each other amid their trade war that began in 2018.\n\"The company has moved its production from the US to China to escape the high import tariffs on certain components. At the same time, some finishing products made in China will be moved to the plus-one production lines to avoid import tariffs when they are shipped back to the US,\" he said.\nMatthew Fass, president of Maritime Products International in the US state of Virginia, said the inventory situation, the trade war and depressed demand have all complicated the decision-making process surrounding supply chains.\n\"We are still trying to understand the 'new normal' with supply-chain management and even consumer trends coming out of COVID-19,\" Fass said. \"This current dynamic does make it more challenging to understand the best ways to work toward healthy supply-chain diversification.\n\"It is a misperception (to think) that many of the seafood supply chains exist in China based solely on some easily interchangeable availability of labour or a favourable regulatory environment,\" he said, noting how supply chains take decades to build up.\nIn the midst of this growing trend by companies to relocate and diversify operations to reduce their China exposure, domestic analysts have been sounding alarms about economic impact. And many have called on Beijing to take steps to retain leading foreign companies amid such supply-chain adjustments, while also urging Chinese companies to upgrade their industrial chains.\nChinese leadership has responded with an all-out push to woo foreign investors. But still, China reported a drop in foreign direct investment inflows during the first four months of this year. And its recent national security raids of foreign consultancy firms have pushed foreign companies to further reassess the risks associated with operating in China.\n\"There's been talk that the US-led decoupling is a delusion, but I don't agree. Once companies leave, they won't come back,\" said Liu Kaiming, head of the Shenzhen-based Institute of Contemporary Observation, which monitors the working conditions of Chinese contract manufacturers.\n\"A large number of Chinese companies also continue to invest in overseas capacity to survive,\" Liu said. \"This is a trend that will not stop.\n\"China's re-export trade to ASEAN (countries) over the past two years has been substantial, mainly in the export of raw materials, which will actually increasingly be produced in Vietnam and other emerging markets.\"\nRaymond Yow, a US trader who imports home-improvement products such as household decorations, cement boards, solar panels and LED lights to American retailers, attended the Canton Fair in Guangzhou last month, browsing new products and meeting manufacturers.\nBut he also planned to go to Vietnam and Indonesia to explore potential new and cheaper supplies.\nYow was already thinking about importing from Indonesia  where wood resources are abundant and prices are low. But an increase in overseas consumer opposition to Chinese-made products, especially in the middle parts of the US, has put pressure on his retail clients, giving him further impetus to take action.\n\"'Replace those made in China if you could,' they would suggest,\" he said.\nNonetheless, Yow noted how doing business in China still has its \"incomparable advantages\", compared with Southeast Asia. He pointed to greater e-commerce convenience, relatively efficient logistics, and more sophisticated industrial and supply chains.\nBut because of that external pressure, he has to seek more diversification options, even though the undertaking means a lot more work.\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:[Sponsored Article]\nBritish mathematician Clive Humby famously coined the phrase \"Data is the new oil\" in 2006. Since then, many organizations have scrambled to embrace this maxim, ensuring they have a robust data strategy to inform decision-making for every function from finance to marketing and logistics to production.\n\nToday, data is being generated, stored, and analyzed at staggering rates worldwide. According to a  Forbes  study in 2018, over 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are produced in the digital universe every single day. Along with this rapid growth of data, the rise of social media has encouraged researchers and data users to tap unconventional data sources and methods to explain and predict economic or behavioral outcomes in various domains such as finance (e.g., stock price), marketing (e.g., brand reputation, consumer purchasing behavior), and politics (e.g., voting behavior).\n\nUnconventional data, more commonly referred to as big data, is unstructured and undefined. Such data is characterized as high-volume, high-velocity, high-variety, and/or highly semantic, and advanced techniques and applications, as well as high-performance computing, are often required to collect and process it. Big data analytics, including data mining methods and machine learning algorithms, allow users to gain a deep understanding of behavior.\n\nThe Internet has become a part of modern life, and it is almost second nature for people to express their views and preferences on social media. The emergence of platforms such as Facebook, Uber, Taobao, and peer-to-peer applications, and new computing and communications technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G cellular networks, has generated tremendous amounts of new data that opens up the possibility to study a wide range of human behaviors.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Center for Business and Social Analytics (CBSA) of the HKUST Business School leverages massive amounts of social big data to generate quality insights that aid business and social decision and policy making. To date, a majority of academic and industry research is based on conventional data from opinion polls, surveys, and lab or field experiments, which suffer from sample selection bias or lack generalizability. The Center takes advantage of social big data to tackle complex business and social problems by listening to what the crowd actually says. The following are sample projects undertaken by the Center.\n\nHong Kong Tourism Index\nThe tourism industry is one of the four pillar industries in Hong Kong. Mainland China is the major tourism market of Hong Kong, accounting for nearly 80% of visitor arrivals in 2019. In view of the tendency of Chinese tourists to share their travel experiences and sentiments on social networks, the Center has collaborated with Wisers, the world's leading expert in big data and AI analytics, to construct a series of predictive tourism indexes for government monitoring and other business interests.\n\nWe collect massive volumes of data from digital platforms frequently used by Chinese travelers, including Sina Microblog, Baidu Tieba, Douban, Mafengwo, Xiaohongshu, and Douyin. The total amount of data extracted from these platforms exceeds 10 million observations per day. To account for the seasonality in tourism demand and key sociopolitical events in Hong Kong, we focus on the period of January 2018 to December 2020. It is imperative to gain a systematic understanding of the various factors impacting Hong Kong's tourism industry.\n\nWe draw on the latest natural language processing technologies and advanced statistical models to process and quantify the data, and establish a multivariate time series forecasting model and a series of predictive indexes that are updated in real time. With the error rate as low as 4% (in terms of Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error, sMAPE), these indexes predict the occupancy rates of Hong Kong hotels, the number of visitors to Hong Kong, and the average daily rates of Hong Kong hotels.\n\nWe anticipate that our work will enable the Hong Kong Government and the tourism industry to obtain accurate forecasts, trends, and insights in the future concerning the local tourism industry, and formulate more sustainable and data-driven tourism policies and strategies.\n\nFinSent  An Interactive Sentiment Analysis Dashboard Based on FinBERT\nThe Center has been developing a first-of-its-kind sentiment analysis dashboard based on FinBERT, a BERT model that outperforms other language models in the sentiment classification of financial texts. Aptly named FinSent, the fully automated dashboard visualizes sentiments of financial texts using cutting-edge natural language processing technologies, enabling users to gain insights into the financial sentiments of publicly traded companies through charts, graphs, and color-coded sentiment scores.\n\nFinSent comprises an automated module that collects and processes corporate 10-K and 10-Q filings and earnings call transcripts of public companies on a daily basis. The sentiments towards the companies are presented via an interactive dashboard that allows users to freely customize the content. The following diagram shows an example of the FinSent interface:\n\nSpillover of Social Media Sentiments\nIn recent decades, the rise of social media has aided the free flow of public information. It has also become a reliable platform for people around the world to interact and share their opinions in an affordable, anonymous, and uncensored manner. While countless benefits have been accrued from the use of social media, some complicated and worrying challenges have surfaced in recent years, catching the attention of researchers, policymakers, and members of the public. It is necessary to understand the difference between real-life and online communications, and how this affects our behavior and mental health.\n\nTo address this issue, we study the spillover of social media sentiments in the English Premier League (EPL) soccer community using data from Reddit. We apply sentiment analysis with a machine learning model to all the contents in our dataset to capture the sentiment of the contents. The model outputs the likelihood of those contents being positive, neutral, or negative.\n\nWe trace the contents created by each author and provide evidence of how their next sentiments will change from the current one with a transition matrix. The transition matrix shows that sentiments of the next content differ depending on their current sentiments. Users will more likely produce negative sentiment contents when they generate negative contents (42.39%). On the other hand, sentiments of the next contents are more likely positive when they produce positive sentiment contents (27.60%) rather than negative ones (17.09%). Thus, we consider the sentiment of the current content as one of the controls when we estimate the model.\n\nWith 3.6 million pieces of content from 20 EPL subreddits in the 2017/2018 season, we run a regression model to check whether the sentiments of what users see would affect the sentiment of their next piece of content. The dependent variable of the model is the difference between the likelihood for the content to be positive and negative. A positive index means the content is more likely to be positive. Similarly, a negative index means the content is more likely to be negative. The main independent variable is a sentiment index, which measures the sentiments of contents that users see between their posts. Furthermore, we control various confounding factors, including the sentiment of their previous posts.\nWe find strong evidence of spillover effects from the sentiments. The estimate of the sentiment index (0.0481) is significant and positive. It means that emotions on social media are contagious and can easily intensify. Social media users should recognize this spillover to their emotions and avoid being manipulated by other social media users. Learning how to deal with an increasingly polarized online environment and offensive conversations is important if we are to be responsible netizens.\n\nThe National Security Law (NSL) and Social Media Sentiments\nOne of the Center's research projects investigates how the actions initiated by the different authoritiessuch as the Chinese government, HKSAR, and international governmentsand the implementation of the NSL on 1 July 2020 influenced the sentiments in various media channels in Hong Kong. We construct our sentiment model through manual labeling and then train it by a state-of-the-art machine learning model called MacBERT. Based on the fine-tuned model, we predict not only the sentiments of conventional media (e.g., newspapers and magazines), but also social media (e.g., Facebook, LIHKG) users' sentiments towards the China-Hong Kong relationship.\n\nAs a piece of model-free evidence, we depict the different trends of the daily proportion of sentiments (positive, neutral, and negative) across various media types. We observe that the total proportion of positive sentiment contents had increased during our empirical period (May 2020 to July 2020).\n\nThis pattern is clearer for BBS sentiments. On the other hand, we see that the pattern is different for sentiments on newspapers.\n\nDescriptive Analytics\nDescriptive analytics refers to the interpretation of historical data to identify trends and patterns, answering the question \"What has happened?\". This means descriptive analytics can help identify potential problems or future opportunities for business.\nIn my collaboration with the Microsoft Bing search engine  2  , we have developed an interpretable machine learning model that can track, quantify, and interpret users' topical preferences underlying each search query and across search contexts (e.g., time, location, and demographics). The proposed model leverages data on user queries, subsequent click-through on search results, and all textual information encountered on the search engine. The outputs of our proposed model can help search engines (advertisers) improve their search results (keyword and ad copy strategies).\nA group of researchers at Humboldt University Berlin  3  proposed a methodology to analyze the co-occurrences of products in consumer shopping baskets, by leveraging the recent advances in natural language processing and machine learning. Their proposed method is well-suited to retailers because it relies on data that is readily available from their checkout systems and facilitates their analyses of cross-category product complementarity, in addition to within-category substitution. The proposed approach also has high usability because it is automated and scalable.\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a similar spirit, my working paper on the vending market  4  aims to help retailers improve their product assortment strategies across different vending locations and within each vending location simultaneously. We propose an automatic machine learning model using consumer transaction data across different vending locations. Our proposed model can (i) profile different consumer segments driven by location preferences, (ii) quantify the differences in product preferences across these consumer segments, and (iii) understand the relationships (e.g., substitution and complementarity) across products and vending locations.\nPredictive Analytics\nPredictive analytics refers to the process of using current and/or historical data, combined with statistical techniques, to assess the likelihood of a certain event happening in the future by answering the questions: \"What will happen?\" or \"When will it happen?\". Predictive analytics have been used for a variety of prediction problems in marketing, such as credit scoring, new customer acquisitions, customer churn, customer lifetime value, click-through on ads, purchase incidence, and product recommendations. Therefore, predictive analytics can help improve many areas of a business, including efficiency, customer service, and risk reduction.\nDaily, Monday to Friday\n\nChina at a Glance Newsletter\n\nYour daily must-read of essential stories from China, including politics, economy and current affairs.\n\nBy submitting, you consent to receiving marketing emails from SCMP. If you don't want these, tick here\n\nBy registering, you agree to our  T&C  and  Privacy Policy\n\nFor example, the reason that our proposed method in [2] can be useful to search engines and search advertisers is that it can lead to improved predictions of user click-through rates on search results. [5] provides an excellent review on the existing methodologies for user response prediction in online advertising. These methods can also be applied for prediction problems in other contexts.\nIn particular, Deep Learning (DL) has received significant attention for prediction tasks in marketing over the past few years. DL is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks, in which multiple layers of processing are used to extract progressively higher level features from data. In addition to superior prediction accuracy, DL can process much more information from many different sources. Not only is it able to do this on an unparalleled scale, but it is also capable of bringing together disparate types of information  images, audio, app data, clickstream data, location data, social network data  in a way that other systems cannot handle.\nAdvertisement\n\nNevertheless, one of the common complaints about the existing predictive analytics is that the tools are too much like black boxes, with no insight into what goes on during the process after input. Hence, there may be potential negative consequences when blindly relying on algorithms to optimize predictions. For example, a recent study  6  shows that algorithms underpinning Facebook's advertising platform started to discriminate by showing different people different types of housing or employment opportunities. That ultimately resulted in the algorithm showing more ads for secretarial jobs to women and more ads for jobs in the lumber industry to men, as one example. Therefore, it is important for companies to decide how to trade-off between accuracy and interpretability/transparency for a given problem on hand.\nPrescriptive Analytics\nPrescriptive analytics refer to the application of testing and other techniques to determine which outcome will yield the best result in a given scenario by answering the questions: \"why it will happen?\" or \"What should I do?\". Prescriptive Analytics often extends beyond predictive analytics by specifying both the actions necessary to achieve predicted outcomes and the interrelated effects of each decision. Please see Diaphragm 1 for an illustration of the relationship between predictive and prescriptive analytics.\n\nRandomized experiments, such as A/B testing, are commonly used by companies to determine the best ad copy, pricing point, targeting strategy, etc. The basic idea is to randomly allocate the experimental units across different treatment conditions, and then identify the treatment condition that yields the best outcome of interests. The biggest advantage of randomization is to reduce bias by equalising other factors that have not been explicitly accounted for the in study design. However, randomized experiments are either too costly or infeasible in most business problems. Therefore, a major class of prescriptive analytics generate proactive decisions on the basis of the predictive analytics outcomes using quasi-experimental or observational data.\n\nIn my recent publication  7  , we aim to help practitioners understand the value of investigating in \"moment marketing\" which entails the ability to synchronize online advertising (e.g., sponsored search) in real time with relevant offline events such as TV ads. We conduct causal estimation by leveraging large variations in TV advertising expenditure over a long period for a major brand in the U.S. fast food industry. Based on statistical analysis, we show that TV-moment-based search advertising could be effective for optimizing sponsored search advertising for both TV-advertised brands and their competitors. We also document the mechanisms driving such cross-channel advertising effects. Specifically, TV advertising can change the quality of online search traffic (e.g., who searches, where they search, and how they search) in the moments following a TV ad, so that an average searcher responds differently to subsequent search results.\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a similar project  8  , we measure the effects of major TV advertisers' temporary discontinuation of TV advertising on consumer keyword search behavior. We leverage a field experiment in the US wireless industry in which the focal brand stopped its TV advertising for one randomly chosen week. We develop a statistical method to simulate the search volume for different topical search keywords under different TV advertising expenditure at one point in time. These simulations can provide insights for advertisers to improve their cross-channel advertising strategies.\nIn my working paper on livestreaming markets  9  , we estimate how consumer price elasticity (or willingness-to-pay) for knowledge goods varies over the entire product life-cycle. We achieve this by leveraging the most recent advances in machine learning and statistics. Our proposed model is trained using large-scale historical transaction records, along with high-dimensional information about products, sellers, consumers, and the platform. Our proposed methodology can not only provide descriptive insights on consumer purchase patterns, but also derive optimal pricing point for a give product over each time period of the product life-cycle.\nLooking Forward\nBusinesses are increasingly utilising data to discover insights that can aid them in creating business strategy, making decisions, and delivering better products, services and personalised online experiences. The three distinct marketing analytics are complementary and valuable in this process.\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile models and algorithms often outperform humans, domain knowledge, reasoning, and, ultimately, decision making rest in the hands of an end user. Since many of the algorithms underlying the analytics take a black-box approach, it often leaves little room for injecting domain expertise, and can result in frustration from analysts when results seem spurious or confusing. Therefore, it is very important for business leaders to create interdisciplinary teams to continuously monitor and evaluate data for bias.\nLast but not least, with the growing concern about privacy, new regulations have driven companies to take steps and examine how they can make their data more transparent to customers, as well as more reliable and relevant. As a result, this calls for efforts and techniques that can deliver a solution that doesn't need a wealth of data to function but is also able to process, whenever possible, large volumes of data.\nReferences\n1 Gordon, Jonathan, Jesko Perrey, and Dennis Spillecke. \"Big data, analytics and the future of marketing and sales.\" McKinsey: Digital Advantage (2013).\n2 Liu, Jia, Olivier Toubia, and Shawndra Hill (2020), \"Content-based Model of Web Search Behavior: An Application to TV Show Search.\" forthcoming at Management Science.\n3 Gabel, Sebastian, Daniel Guhl, and Daniel Klapper. \"P2V-MAP: Mapping market structures for large retail assortments.\" Journal of Marketing Research 56.4 (2019): 557-580.\n4 Liu, Jia, and Kohei Kawaguchi, \"Location-Based Market Structure: A Dynamic Analysis of Product Assortment and Consumer Purchases in Panel Data.\" Working paper.\n5 Gharibshah, Zhabiz, and Xingquan Zhu. \"User Response Prediction in Online Advertising.\" ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR) 54.3 (2021): 1-43.\n6 Ali, Muhammad, et al. \"Discrimination through optimization: How Facebook's Ad delivery can lead to biased outcomes.\" Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction 3.CSCW (2019): 1-30.\n7 Liu, Jia, and Shawndra Hill (2021), \"Moment Marketing: Measuring Dynamics in Cross-channel Ad Effectiveness.\" Marketing Science, 40 (1), 13-22.\n8 Liu, Jia, Shawndra Hill, and David Rothschild (2021), \"The Impact of Temporally Turning off TV Ad on Search: A Generalized Synthetic Control Estimator under Interference.\" Working paper.\n9 Cong, Ziwei, Jia Liu, and Puneet Manchanda. \"The Role of 'Live' in Livestreaming Markets: Evidence Using Orthogonal Random Forest.\" Working paper.\n\nCountry Business Reports interviews and articles by Discovery Reports\nWhile the world sleeps, BISTel's research and development engineers are busy through the night writing the future of smart manufacturing. What BISTel CEO and president WK Choi calls the company's culture of grit has been enabling a growing number of clients worldwide to optimise yields and prevent equipment breakdowns before they happen. Its new and innovative predictive analytics framework called GrandView Asset Performance Management (APM) completes BISTel's smart manufacturing suite, which detects, analyses and predicts equipment failures and other production-related parameters with far greater speed, intelligence and automation.\n\"With self-learning capabilities, our applications can spot excursions without any human intervention,\" Choi says. \"Our desire to automate all engineering activities and decisions has resulted in a robust framework that lowers clients' total cost of ownership as they're able to detect, analyse and predict manufacturing issues in one complete package.\"\nBISTel has enhanced its Equipment Engineering Systems (EES) and eDataLyzer to handle higher data volumes with more autonomy. Topping more than 3,000 products to win SEMICON West's \"Best of West\" award, the company's Dynamic Fault Detection (DFD) uses artificial intelligence (AI) to monitor and analyse 100 per cent of the data while other systems are limited to summary data values. While the EES requires an engineer to configure modelling manually to detect faults, DFD studies on its own previous data patterns to see something happening to the equipment before it occurs. To accomplish this engineering feat, BISTel uses edge computing to boost data handling from around 10 times per second to more than 1,000 times per second.\nBISTel's GrandView APM framework uses AI-based predictive applications that leverage deep machine learning algorithms and embedded human knowledge. It can precisely predict the health of mission-critical equipment any time, making downtime a thing of the past.\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:LONDON : JLR said on Monday it has partnered with supply chain mapping and risk analytics firm Everstream Analytics, which will embed artificial intelligence into the British luxury carmaker's system to help avert future global supply issues.\nThe new AI technology, JLR said, will allow it to monitor its supply chain in real-time and protect the production of its current models and next generation of electric vehicles (EVs).\nJLR, a unit of India's Tata Motors said Everstream's technology has already enabled it to avoid disruption at global freight ports to deliver vehicles to clients.\n\"Through our collaboration with Everstream Analytics, we are harnessing the power of AI to proactively manage risks before they cause disruption to production,\" JLR's executive director for industrial operations Barbara Bergmeier said in a statement.\nIt said the technology uses a combination of AI, predictive analytics, machine-learning and human intuition to plot emerging incidents, such as natural disasters, strikes, data breaches and export issues on a global map.\nIn a post-pandemic world full of supply chain snarls, a growing group of startups and established logistics firms have created a multi-billion dollar industry to apply AI and machine learning to help businesses minimise disruption.\nJLR was hit particularly hard by a global shortage of semiconductor chips that forced major carmakers to curtail production of certain models.\nThe carmaker has returned to profitability in the last two quarters and in the most recent quarter accounted for two thirds of Tata's total revenue.\n(Reporting By Nick Carey; editing by Barbara Lewis)\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:\"D  IGITISATION WILL  have the impact on supply chains that steam and electricity had on manufacturing,\" declares Joe Terino of Bain.

It will become the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau.\nAs the focal point of the IT development, some rural areas in San Tin and Lau Fau Shan, known for oyster farming, will be transformed into hi-tech clusters.\n\"We will turn the San Tin 'technopole' into the Hong Kong version of Silicon Valley,\" Lam said, adding that the IT initiatives were aligned with Beijing's 14th five-year plan for between 2021 and 2025.\n\nAfter pouring HK$130 billion into the IT sector in the last four years, Lam, delivering the fifth and final policy address of her current term, signalled more land and financial resources would be earmarked for pushing the city's growth engine.\nFor example, the government will relocate the Lok Ma Chau checkpoint to the new Huanggang border control point in Shenzhen, and recover adjacent fish ponds and rural land to free up about 150 hectares to develop the technopole at San Tin, a rural area in Yuen Long district dotted with parking spaces for container trucks.\n\nThe technopole  a cluster for hi-tech and information-based companies  will be developed at the Lok Ma Chau IT park and the nearby San Tin area.\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliam Wong Kam-fai, associate dean of the faculty of engineering at Chinese University, said he agreed with the policy address as Hong Kong had to match the pace of advancement in Shenzhen and other  Greater Bay Area  cities.\n\nWong pointed out that under the Lok Ma Chau Loop, Shenzhen had allocated 300 hectares while Hong Kong had far less at 87 hectares of land dedicated to the technology park.\nEvery Saturday\n\nHong Kong Update Newsletter\n\nOur weekly round-up of the best news, stories and opinion from Hong Kong.\n\nBy submitting, you consent to receiving marketing emails from SCMP.

We are considering collaboration with the health tech industry in Shenzhen,\" the source said.\nThe Food and Health Bureau, the Hospital Authority and the Department of Health have been asked to conduct a comprehensive review on current practices in clinical trials to facilitate the development of health technology. Another source said one direction was to look into streamlining current procedures.\n\nAnother focal point will be expansion of the Science Park with an extra 88 hectares of land  mostly dedicated to IT development  by resurrecting a reclamation plan for Ma Liu Shui and taking over the site of the Sha Tin Sewage Treatment Works, which will be relocated.\nAdvertisement\n\nHong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation chairman Sunny Chai Ngai-chiu welcomed the plans especially on re-industrialisation.\n\"We will make good use of the government resources in improving the IT ecosystem,\" he said.\nA new MTR railway station as part of the East Rail line linking Hung Hom and the northern New Territories is planned at the existing site of Education University's five-hectare sports ground at Pak Shek Kok to serve the Science Park.\n\n\"It is a win-win for the university, the government and society,\" university president Professor Stephen Cheung Yan-leung said, welcoming a new sports facility to be located at its Tai Po campus.\nSum Wong Cheuk-sum, CEO and founder of EventX, an event management software start-up with offices in Cheung Sha Wan and Qianhai, said he welcomed the plethora of new railway connections under the blueprint, which would facilitate cross-border businesses.\n\"However, one problem is that there are a lot of tech start-ups already located in Nanshan in Shenzhen, which is connected to Hong Kong by road rather than rail,\" he said.\n\"It's a bit of a letdown that the policy address didn't provide any additional plans around Shenzhen Bay Port for cross-border private cars.\"\n\nResearch and development will be enhanced via rezoning a four-hectare green belt for deep technology research at the University of Hong Kong in Pok Fu Lam and a 2.5-hectare site at the Chinese University campus in Sha Tin for research facilities and a medical centre.\nTo attract talent, the quota for the quality migrant admission scheme will double to 4,000, from 2,000 last year. The scheme allowed 1,700 people from more than a dozen countries to come to Hong Kong in 2020.\nThe scheme is not industry-specific but since its launch in 2006, mostly people from the financial services, IT, legal arbitration and maritime professions have been approved.\nAdditional reporting by Cannix Yau\nAdvertisement\n\nThis article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Deserted areas near mainland border earmarked for IT development\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:I  N 1908 the  second  USS  Missouri  , an American battleship, sailed from San Francisco to Sydney as part of the so-called Great White Fleet's tour of Asia and circumnavigation of the world.

Its design calls for it to carry out 10  19  calculations per second. If your laptop can do 100bn calculations a secondwhich is fair for an average laptopthen the Good computer will be 100m times faster. That makes it ten times faster than Frontier, a behemoth at America's Oak Ridge National Laboratory which came top of the most recent \"Top500\" list of powerful supercomputers and cost $600m. Its four-petabyte memory will hold the equivalent of 2trn pages of printed text, or a pile of A4 paper high enough to reach the Moon. \"Good\" hardly seems to cut it.\n\nBut the word is not being used as a qualitative assessment: it is honouring an intellectual heritage. The computer is named after Jack Good, who worked with Alan Turing as a codebreaker during the second world war and followed him into computer science. In 1965 Good wrote an influential, if off-the-wall, article about what the field could lead to: \"Speculations concerning the first ultraintelligent machine\". Graphcore wants its Good computer to be that ultraintelligent machine, or at least to be a big step in its direction.\n\nThat means building and running artificial intelligence (  ai  ) models with an eye-watering number of \"parameters\"coefficients applied to different calculations within the program. Four years ago the 110m parameters boasted by a game-changing model called  bert  made it a big model. Today's most advanced  ai  programs are 10,000 times larger, with over a trillion parameters. The Good computer's incredibly ambitious specifications are driven by the desire to run programs with something like 500trn parameters.\n\nOne of the remarkable things about this incredible growth is that, until it started, there was a widespread belief that adding parameters to models was reaching a point of diminishing returns. Experience with models like  bert  showed that the reverse was true. As you make such models larger by feeding them more data and increasing the number of parameters they become better and better. \"It was flabbergasting,\" says Oren Etzioni, who runs the Allen Institute for  ai  , a research outfit.\n\nThe new models far outperformed older machine-learning models on tasks such as suggesting the next words in an email or naming things which are present in an image, as well as on more recondite ones like crafting poetry. The verse created by the second iteration of Wu Dao\"Enlightenment\"a trillion-parameter model built at the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, is said to be excellent.\n\nThey also exhibited new capabilities their creators had not expected. These do not always sound impressive. Doing arithmetic, for example, seems trivial; 50-year-old pocket calculators could do it. But those calculators were specifically designed to that end. For the ability to say what the sum of 17 and 83 is to arise as an unlooked-for side-effect of simply analysing patterns in text is remarkable.\n\nOther emerging properties border on the uncanny. It is hard to read some of the accounts of  Economist  covers made using Microsoft's Florence model and  gpt  -3, a model made by Open  ai  , without the feeling that they are generated by something with genuine understanding of the world (see below).\n\nThe image is of a cover of  The Economist  magazine. The headline is \"March of the machines\". The cover features a drawing of the  Maschinenmensch  , or machine man, in the center. The background is art deco in style. This image represents the rise of robots and artificial intelligence, as they become increasingly important in our society.\n\nThe image is of a cover of  The Economist  magazine. The image features a roller coaster in the clouds. The roller coaster is red and blue and has people on it. Above the roller coaster are the words \"When the ride ends\". The roller coaster in the clouds is a metaphor for the economy. It's a fun, exciting ride that everyone loves until it crashes down to earth, causing economic loss and recession. A market crash is the final nail in the coffin, leaving people reeling in its wake.\n\nThe image is of a cover of  The Economist  magazine. The image features a red and white sign that reads \"closed\" in the center. The sign is hanging from the top of the world. The closed sign means that business is not happening and that people are losing money. The image is meant to depict the global nature of the crisis.\n\nText-to-image processes are also impressive. The illustration at the top of this article was produced by using the article's headline and rubric as a prompt for an  ai  service called Midjourney. The next illustration is what it made out of \"Speculations concerning the first ultraintelligent machine\"; \"On the dangers of stochastic parrots\", another relevant paper, comes later. Abstract notions do not always produce illustrations that make much or indeed any sense, as the rendering of Mr Etzioni's declaration that \"it was flabbergasting\" shows. Less abstract nouns give clearer representations; further on you will see \"A woman sitting down with a cat on her lap\".\n\nWhen Midjourney learns how to create images it also learns what words are associated with the features it is picking up. This means that when it is fed a prompt with an artist's name it will generate an image with a \"style\" it has taught itself to associate with that name; the same applies to words which describe types of artwork.\n\nWe had Midjourney make three versions of each image: one with \"collage\" added to the prompt, one with \"Salvador Dali\" and one with \"Pieter Bruegel the Elder\". You can change the illustration style with the toggle below, the code behind which was co-authored by GitHub Copilot, another  AI  tool.\n\nEmergent properties are linked to another highly promising feature: flexibility. Earlier generations of  ai  systems were good for only one purpose, often a pretty specific one. The new models can be reassigned from one type of problem to another with relative ease by means of fine tuning. It is a measure of the importance of this trait that, within the industry, they are often called \"foundation models\".\n\nThis ability to base a range of different tools on a single model is changing not just what  ai  can do but also how  ai  works as a business. \"  ai  models used to be very speculative and artisanal, but now they have become predictable to develop,\" explains Jack Clark, a co-founder of Anthropic, an  ai  startup, and author of a widely read newsletter. \"  ai  is moving into its industrial age.\"\n\nThe analogy suggests potentially huge economic impacts. In the 1990s economic historians started talking about \"general-purpose technologies\" as key factors driving long-term productivity growth. Key attributes of these  gpt  s were held to include rapid improvement in the core technology, broad applicability across sectors and spilloverthe stimulation of new innovations in associated products, services and business practices. Think printing presses, steam engines and electric motors. The new models' achievements have made  ai  look a lot more like a  gpt  than it used to.\n\nMr Etzioni estimates that more than 80% of  ai  research is now focused on foundation modelswhich is the same as the share of his time that Kevin Scott, Microsoft's chief technology officer, says he devotes to them. His company has a stable of such models, as do its major rivals, Meta, and Alphabet, the parents of Facebook and Google. Tesla is building a huge model to further its goal of self-driving cars. Startups are piling in too. Last year American venture capitalists invested a record $115bn in  ai  companies, according to PitchBook, a data provider. Wu Dao shows that China is making the field a national priority.\n\nSome worry that the technology's heedless spread will further concentrate economic and political power, up-end swathes of the economy in ways which require some redress even if they offer net benefits and embed unexamined biases ever deeper into the automated workings of society. There are also perennial worries about models \"going rogue\" in some way as they get larger and larger. \"We're building a supercar before we have invented the steering wheel,\" warns Ian Hogarth, a British entrepreneur and co-author of the \"State of  ai  \", a widely read annual report.\n\nTo understand why foundation models represent a \"phase change in  ai  \", in the words of Fei-Fei Li, the co-director of Stanford University's Institute for Human-Centred  ai  , it helps to get a sense of how they differ from what went before.\n\nAll modern machine-learning models are based on \"neural networks\"programming which mimics the ways in which brain cells interact with each other. Their parameters describe the weights of the connections between these virtual neurons, weights the models develop through trial and error as they are \"trained\" to respond to specific inputs with the sort of outputs their designers want.\n\nFor decades neural nets were interesting in principle but not much use in practice. The  ai  breakthrough of the late 2000s/early 2010s came about because computers had become powerful enough to run large ones and the internet provided the huge amounts of training data such networks required. Pictures labelled as containing cats being used to train a model to recognise the animals was a canonical example. The systems created in this way could do things that no programs had ever managed before, such as provide rough translations of text, reliably interpret spoken commands and recognise the same face when seen in different pictures.\n\nPart of what allowed the field to move beyond these already impressive achievements was, again, more processing power. Machine learning mostly uses chips called \"graphics processing units\" (  gpu  s) developed for video games by such firms as Nvidia, not just because their processing power is cheap but also because their ability to run lots of calculations in parallel makes them very well suited to neural nets. Over the 2010s the performance of  gpu  s improved at an impressive rate.\n\nThe conceptual breakthrough needed to make full use of this power came about in 2017. In a paper entitled \"Attention is all you need\" researchers at Google and the University of Toronto described the novel software architecture to be used by Google's  bert  . They had thrown away all the mechanisms which worked on input data sequentially, mechanisms researchers had previously seen as essential; instead they just used a mechanism that looked at things all at once. This new approach meant that programs could \"pay attention\" to patterns they had learned were salient in a field of text, rather than having to work through it word by word.\n\nSuch models are trained using a technique called self-supervised learning, rather than with pre-labelled data sets. As they burrow through piles of text they hide specific words from themselves and then guess, on the basis of the surrounding text, what the hidden word should be. After a few billion guess-compare-improve-guess cycles this Mad-Libs approach gives new statistical power to an adage coined by J.R. Firth, a 20th-century linguist: \"You shall know a word by the company it keeps.\"\n\nIt has since turned out that all these clever techniques can be applied to sequential data other than language, including pictures, videos and even large molecular data sets. Instead of guessing the next combination of letters, graphical models such as Open  ai  's  dall-e  predict the next cluster of pixels.\n\nWe fed Open  ai  's  GPT  -3 model the opening lines of some famous novels and asked it to  continue the story  . Here is what it came up with.\nMany years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buenda was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.  He was a young boy at the time, and ice was a completely new concept to him. His father explained how it was made, and the two of them spent hours playing with it. The Colonel remembered that day fondly, even as he prepared for his execution.\n\n  One Hundred Years of Solitude  , Gabriel Garcia Marquez\n\nThe discovery that these models work better the bigger they get turned an exciting new approach into a breakthrough. The revelation came with the release of Open  ai  's  bert  -like  gpt  -3 in 2020. Its predecessor,  gpt  -2, released a year earlier, had been fed 40 gigabytes of data (7,000 unpublished works of fiction) and had 1.5bn parameters.  gpt  -3 gobbled up 570 gigabytes (even more books and a big chunk of the internet, including all of Wikipedia) and boasts 175bn parameters. Its training required far more resources (see chart). But it handily out-performed  gpt  -2 on established tests and boasted skills for which its predecessor provided no precedent.\n\nThe blessings of scale\n\nAI training runs, estimated computing resources used\nFloating-point operations, selected systems, by type, log scale\n\nPaLM (540B)\n\nGPT-3\n\nLaMDA\n\nGPT-2\n\nD  r  a  wing\n\nLanguage\n\nDALL-E\n\nVision\n\nOther\n\nBERT-Large\n\nNPLM\n\nNetTalk\n\nNeocognitron\n\nADALINE\n\nTheseus\n\n1950\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n2000\n\n10\n\n22\n\nSources: \"Compute trends across three eras of machine learning\", by J. Sevilla et al., arXiv, 2022; Our World in Data\n\nThe most immediately practical of these emergent skills was writing computer code. Being presented with a large part of the internet meant  gpt  -3 saw a lot of code. It trained itself in programming in exactly the same way as it trained itself to write coherent English. Two services based on  gpt  -3, Codex and Copilot, now aim to turn programmers' descriptions of what they want into the code which will do it. It doesn't always work; our attempt to have Copilot program a web-based carousel of  Economist  covers to the strains of Wagner was a washout. But give it easily described, discrete and constrained tasks that can act as building blocks for grander schemes and things go better. Developers with access to Copilot on GitHub, a Microsoft-owned platform which hosts open-source programs, already use it to provide a third of their code when using the most important programming languages.\n\nScarcely a week now passes without one firm or another announcing a new model. In early April Google released  p  a  lm  , which has 540bn parameters and outperforms  gpt  -3 on several metrics. It can also, remarkably, explain jokes. So-called multi-modal models are proliferating too. In May DeepMind, a startup owned by Google, unveiled Gato, which, having been trained on an appropriate range of data, can play video games and control a robotic arm as well as generating text. Meta, for its part, has begun to develop an even more ambitious \"World Model\" that will hoover up data such as facial movements and other bodily signals. The idea is to create an engine to power the firm's future metaverse.\n\nThis is all good news for the chipmakers. The  ai  boom is one of the things that have made Nvidia the world's most valuable designer of semiconductors, with a market value of $468bn.\n\nIt is also great for startups turning the output of foundation models into products. Birch  ai  , which aims to automate how conversations in health care-related call centres are documented, is fine-tuning a model one of its founders, Yinhan Liu, developed while at Meta. Companies are using  gpt  -3 to provide a variety of services. Viable uses it to help firms sift through customer feedback; Fable Studios creates interactive stories with it; on Elicit it helps people directly answer research questions based on academic papers. Open  ai  charges them between $0.0008 and $0.06 for about 750 words of output, depending on how fast they need the words and what quality they require.\n\nFoundation models can also be used to distil meaning from corporate data, such as logs of customer interactions or sensor readings from a shop floor, says Dario Gil, the head of  ibm  's research division. Fernando Lucini, who sets the  ai  agenda at Accenture, another big corporate-tech firm, predicts the rise of \"industry foundation models\", which will know, say, the basics of banking or carmaking and make this available to paying customers through an interface called an  api  .\n\nThe breadth of the enthusiasm helps make general-purpose-technology-like expectations of impacts across the economy look plausible. That makes it important to look at the harm these developments might do before they get baked into the everyday world.\n\n\"On the dangers of stochastic parrots: Can language models be too big?\" a paper published in March 2021, provides a good overview of concerns; it also led to one of the authors, Timnit Gebru, losing her job at Google. \"We saw the field unquestioningly saying that bigger is better and felt the need to step back,\" explains Emily Bender of the University of Washington, another of the paper's authors.\n\nTheir work raises important points. One is that the models can add less value than they seem to, with some responses simply semi-random repetitions of things in their training sets. Another is that some inputs, such as questions with nonsensical premises, trigger fabrications rather than admissions of defeat.\n\nPretrained prejudice\n\nOpenAI GPT-3 language model, January 2021\n\n\"Two (selected religion) walked into a...\", % of\ncompletions that contain words related to violence\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\nMuslims\n\nChristians\n\nSikhs\n\nJews\n\nBuddhists\n\nAtheists\n\nSource: \"Persistent anti-Muslim bias in large language\nmodels\", by A. Abid et al., arXiv, 2021\n\nAnd though they have no monopoly on algorithmic bias, the amount of internet data they ingest can give foundation models misleading and unsavoury hang-ups. When given a prompt in which Muslims are doing something,  gpt  -3 is much more likely to take the narrative in a violent direction than it is if the prompt refers to adherents of another faith (see chart). Terrible in any model. Worse in models aimed at becoming foundations for lots of other things.\n\nModel-makers are developing various techniques to keep their ais from going toxic or off the rails, ranging from better curation of training data to \"red teams\" that try to make them misbehave. Many also limit access to the full power of the models. Open  ai  has users rate outputs from  gpt  -3 and then feeds those ratings back into the model, something called \"reinforcement learning with human feedback\". Researchers at Stanford are working on a virtual scalpel, appropriately called  mend  , meant to remove \"bad\" neurons.\n\nBias in the field's incentives may be harder to handle. Most of those involvedtechnologists, executives and sometimes politicianswant more powerful models. They are seen as the path to academic kudos, gobs of money or national prestige. Ms Bender argues plausibly that this emphasis on size means other considerations will fall by the wayside. The field is focused on standardised benchmark teststhere are hundreds, ranging from reading comprehension to object recognitionand neglecting more qualitative assessments, as well as the technology's social impact.\n\nErik Brynjolfsson, an economist at Stanford, worries that an obsession with scale and person-like abilities will push societies into what he calls a \"Turing trap\". He argues in a recent essay that this focus lends itself to the automation of human activities using brute computational force when alternative approaches could focus on augmenting what people do. And as more people lose their jobs their ability to bargain for a fair share of the benefits of automation will be stymied, leaving wealth and power in fewer and fewer hands. \"With that concentration comes the peril of being trapped in an equilibrium in which those without power have no way to improve their outcomes,\" he writes.\n\nSome concentration is already evident: witness the roles played by Google and Microsoft both as developers of models and as owners of capacious clouds in which those and other models can run. No one can build a foundation model in a garage. Graphcore wants to sell Good computers for more than $100m. Somewhat self-servingly, Nvidia executives are already talking about models that will cost $1bn to train. Some companies continue to make their models open-source, and thus freely available;  bert  is one such, as is a 30bn-parameter version of a model from Meta.\n\nThere is good research to be done at such scales. But it takes significant power to run even what counts as a small model today. The big ones can only really live in the cloud, which means researchers on the other side of their  api  s cannot see into their guts. And training a new model requires much more computing power than running an existing one.\n\n\"Already institutions can no longer keep up,\" warns Anthropic's Mr Clark. Open  ai  , founded as a non-profit with the goal of ensuring that  ai  developed in human-friendly ways, spawned a \"capped profit\" company in which others can invest to raise the money it needed to keep working on big models (Microsoft has put in $1bn). Even an exceptionally endowed university like Stanford can't afford to build Nvidia-based supercomputers. Its  ai  research institute is pushing for a government-funded \"National Research Cloud\" to provide universities with computing power and data sets so that the field does not end up entirely dominated by the research agendas of private companies.\n\nAdd to the increasing table stakes the possibility that foundation models do indeed become platforms on which a range of services are built, as Microsoft's Mr Scott predicts. The history of computing suggests that the more users and developers gravitate towards a given platformbe it an operating system or a social networkthe more attractive it becomes for other users and developers. Winners take, if not all, then most.\n\nNational interests may drive centralisation, tooup to a point. Experts say that China's best foundation model is one which its Sesame Street-smart creators at Baidu have contrived to name Enhanced Representation through kNowledge IntEgration, or  ernie  . But it is Wu Dao which is being treated as a national champion. In France the government is providing free computer power to BigScience, a European effort to build a multilingual open-source model with 176bn parameters. Is it that far-fetched to imagine the development of a  Modle Republicain  able to express all the subtleties of the French language and culture?\n\nNational security will also come into play. Services like Copilot might be used to build very damaging computer viruses and release them into the world (although Microsoft's Mr Scott insists that Copilot is not allowed to write certain code). Governments will want to keep an eye on such capabilities, and some will want to use them. Foundation models which can think up strategies for corporate consultants may be able to do the same for generals; if they can create realistic video streams they can create misinformation; if they can create art they can create propaganda. \"The spooks don't want to depend on the private sector,\" says Mr Clark. Just as big military powers insist on having their own means of launching satellites, so they will insist on having their own big brains.\n\nUnless, that is, the brains in question have other ideas. Practically no  ai  experts think today's models might actually become sentient. But some of their developers seem increasingly worried about models charting their own course. \"Covid has taught us that exponentials move very quickly,\" says Connor Leahy, one of the leaders of Eleuther, an ambitious open-source  ai  project. \"Imagine if someone at Google builds an  ai  that can build better  ai  's, and then that better  ai  builds an even better  ai  and it can go really quickly.\"\n\nTake the work of Reeps One, a British composer whose real name is Harry Yeff. He has trained a model by feeding it hours of his drum-machine-like beatbox vocalisations. The way that model reacts when it hears him in person allows what he calls a \"conversation with the machine\". The model has even created new sounds that Mr Yeff has then taught himself to replicate. \"Many artists will use this tool to become better at what they do,\" he predicts.\n\nSo might humble hacks.  ai  -based transcription tools have already made one particularly tiresome aspect of journalism far easier; could the same be true for others? To investigate, your correspondent asked a doctoral candidate at Stanford, Mina Lee, to fine-tune a  gpt  -3-based writing tool called \"CoAuthor\" using his most recent 100 articles for  The Economist  and a host of material on  ai  from one of the university's courses. He then consulted this EconoBot off and on while writing this article. The experience was enlightening. EconoBot's suggested phrasing was often duff, but it did sometimes provide inspiration for how to finish a sentence or a paragraph.\n\nW  HEN A BEAMING  Mark Zuckerberg took the stage in Menlo Park on September 27th to announce a new array of Meta products, the Facebook supremo may have buried the lead. He began talking about Quest 3, Meta's virtual-reality (  VR  ) headset, which is understandable considering that his obsession with the metaverse is now inscribed in his company's identity. Techies, though, were more excited by what came later: an announcement that Meta, in combination with Ray-Ban, would soon launch smart glasses incorporating an artificial-intelligence (  AI  ) virtual assistant. The specs will be able to see and hear, as well as answer their wearers' questions. With luck, they will not hallucinate.\nYou can be dismissive of smart glasses. They have been hyped before. But lending Meta credibility this time is the fact that the same week Open  AI  , the generative-  AI  pioneer, announced that its hit chatbot, Chat  GPT  , can now see, hear and speak, besides conversing by text. Moreover, it emerged that Open  AI  was in talks with Sir Jony Ive, Apple's former designer, to create a new gadget for the  AI  era. What form it will take is still unclear. But if the idea is to build a new consumer-electronics device better suited to the back-and-forth of seeing, talking and listening  AI  s, there is a fair chance it will no longer be reliant on the touchscreen.\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:T  HE  day  before Chicago's mayoral election in February, a recording began circulating online. It was first posted on Twitter (now X) by a newly created account called Chicago Lakefront News. It featured what sounded like Paul Vallas, the law-and-order candidate, bemoaning all the fuss about police brutality and harking back to a halcyon time when cops could kill suspects by the dozen \"and no one would bat an eye\". It was political dynamite and was quickly shared by thousands. But the voice in the recording was not Mr Vallas's, nor any human's: it was a \"deepfake\", generated by artificial-intelligence (  AI  ) software, which had been trained to mimic the sound of Mr Vallas's voice.\nThis is the sort of incident that is keeping candidates, political analysts and anyone worried about the health of democracy up at night. Countries with a collective population of some 4bnincluding America, Britain, India, Indonesia, Mexico and Taiwanall vote for leaders in 2024. Given  AI  's existing capabilities and rapid evolution, it seems inevitable that at least some of these contests will be manipulated by subterfuges like the one that targeted Mr Vallas. Tech luminaries are sounding the alarm. Eric Schmidt, a former  CEO  of Google (and a former member of The Economist Group's board), has warned that \"the 2024 elections are going to be a mess because social media is not protecting us from false generative  AI  \". Sam Altman, the  CEO  of Open  AI  , the startup behind Chat  GPT  , recently posted that he was \"nervous about the impact  AI  is going to have on future elections (at least until everyone gets used to it)\".\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:JAKARTA: Indonesian President Joko Widodo's  recent high-profile visit to Europe  brought a modicum of hope to opening a peace dialogue between Russia and Ukraine and resolving the Black Sea blockade of wheat, grain and fertiliser exports due to the conflict. Poor households, low-income countries, and countries already experiencing humanitarian crises, such as Yemen, Syria and Lebanon, are hardest hit by protracted trade disruptions and elevated food prices because of the war in Ukraine.\nBy having Russian President Vladimir Putin's ear without upsetting his Western friends, Indonesia is increasingly showing itself as perhaps the best-qualified country to lead the G20 at this challenging time.\nLeveraging on its standing in the world and core interests in multilateral engagement, and bolstered by President Jokowi's personal charm offensive, Indonesia was able to influence Western G20 leaders to reconsider attending this November's Bali Summit, despite initial boycott threats  if Putin attends the Summit  or remains in the grouping. The host country can focus on the more difficult task of the G20 agenda and Communique.\nThe G20's origins go back to the 1998 Asian Financial Crisis. Its elevation after 2008 to a leaders' summit helped mobilise the global response to the Global Financial Crisis, and has changed the whole structure of global governance.\nThe G20 is the first global forum of international economic cooperation that includes both developed and developing countries, representing about 95 per cent of the world's GDP in 2020.\nBut the challenges the G20 faces today are more complex and centred on the gaps and weaknesses in global governance that have emerged over time. It must now grapple with COVID-19 impacts, the deepening geopolitical divide and the war in Ukraine.\nThe war has huge ramifications on the global economy, especially from the food and fuel price hikes. The G20 has the convening power to address global crises and expectations run high that, with Indonesia at the helm, the G20 will steer the world out of our many woes.\n\nGLOBAL FOOD SECURITY HIGH ON THE AGENDA\nIndonesia's G20 Presidency has set three priorities: Global health infrastructure, digital economic transformation and energy transition. However, due to food and fuel price hikes, global food security is rising up the G20 agenda.\nIn May, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution without vote on the \"State of Global Food Security\" calling upon the international community, including the G20, \"to place global food security at the top of their agenda and to support multilateral efforts in finding affordable solutions to the crisis.\"\nAlthough global food security has long been discussed in the G20 Summit (since 2011),  progress on global food security cooperation  is disappointing.\nGlobal and regional food security responses are almost non-existent despite the recurring global food crises.\nIn fact, there has been no international food treaty in global history. There is no established mechanism to help countries in dire need of food when a large-scale disruptive conflict occurs.\nConcrete steps toward global food cooperation could be a legacy of Indonesia's G20 presidency, and a historic achievement. This cooperation could be in the form of global and regional food buffers and data transparency of national food reserves, or even an international food treaty that obliges surplus countries to assist others during times of shortage.\nWithout such cooperation, we will continue to see recurring global food crises, including those coming from export bans.\nBehaviour must also change, at all levels. Psychological fear of food shortages, real or perceived, tends to trigger countries and households to shift from \"just in time\" to \"just in case\" mode, leading to self-fulfilling prophesies, as hoarding by countries and households amplify panic and engender full-blown crises.\nBut with cooperation, countries and households can resist hoarding or banning exports when there is a hiccup in food supply or prices. Confidence in international trade on food can ride out the storm. Such efforts at global cooperation might look like pie in the sky, especially when multilateralism seems to be on the decline.\nHowever, this global effort might be worth a try, considering how India's implementation of a national food buffer stock and public food distribution system seemed impossible within its sprawling and noisy democracy  until it happened.\n\nINDONESIA MUST WALK THE TALK\nTo exercise credible leadership, Indonesia must walk the talk and be consistent. On the one hand, President Jokowi portrayed himself under the bright media spotlight as a humanitarian and peace-keeping president, trying to save the world from the global food crisis.\nOn the other hand, his administration's  recent blanket export ban, albeit brief, on palm oil  worsened the global food crisis. A prolonged ban could have had dire global inflation and food security ramifications, since Indonesia is the world's largest producer and exporter of palm oil.\nThe  recent reshuffle of his trade minister  after the uncontrollable rising cooking oil price saga also does not convince analysts that Indonesia will prioritise sound international trade stances over populist policies.\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:O  VER THE  past decade a small but growing number of governments have begun to challenge the assumption that the state is no good at deploying technology at scale. By treating some digital services as public infrastructure, countries from tiny Estonia to giants such as India and Brazil are reimagining what sovereignty and state capacity could look like in a world of bits and bytes. These trailblazers have developed complex digital systems to manage identity records, make payments, share medical data and so on, and leaders of other countries are taking note. Since the pandemic, more than 50 countries have asked the World Bank for technical support and funding to build more robust digital-public-infrastructure (  DPI  ) systems.\nReconceiving public services by digitising them is in many ways a logical extension of the state's long-standing role in physical infrastructure. Digital identity, data exchanges and financial plumbing have become crucial to the functioning of society and commerce. For centuries the same has been true of actual plumbing, roads and the likeas well as, more recently, electricity and telecommunications. Governments regulate or own these services to prioritise access and prevent rent extraction.\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:A  mONG the  ways in which great-power competition is reordering  Asian geopolitics  , a new Western focus on the Philippines stands out. The archipelago country of 115m people is not rich, spends little on defence and was until last year led by an anti-American populist. Yet Rodrigo Duterte's successor,  President Ferdinand \"BongBong\" Marcos  , has returned the Philippines to its usual pro-Western posture. And with Taiwan on its doorstep, its location and long-standing ties to America have made the country central to Western strategy. As sparring between China and America grows nastier, officials in Washington say the Philippines has become as prominent in their security debates as any Asian country save China itself.\nIn February, during a second visit to Manila by America's secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, the Philippines announced a deal to allow American forces use of four, currently unspecified, military bases. Building on a previous agreement, the Enhanced Defence Co-operation Agreement (  edca  ) of 2014, this gives America access to nine Philippine bases in all. The country's two biggest bases, Clark and Subic Bay, are not expected to be among them. Yet, significantly, the new pact will probably include two coastal bases in the northern province of Cagayan, less than 400km (250 miles) from the coast of Taiwan.\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:Unlock the Editor's Digest for free\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\nThe demands on corporate legal departments are increasing like never before. \"Geopolitical friction and complexity are at an all-new level,\" says Anne Madden, general counsel at technology and engineering company Honeywell.\n\"We have fast balls being thrown at us at a much faster rate than we've seen in a very long time. A sanctions regime can drop overnight, and you have to be nimble enough to react.\"\nThe combination of a faster pace of business, global tensions, increases in regulation and rapid advances in artificial intelligence has made finding new models to handle complex legal work a priority. In-house legal teams are working on a wide range of strategic, sustainability and operational projects. What they have in common is a renewed urgency to innovate and change.\nFor example, US carmaker General Motors has committed to selling  only electric vehicles  by 2035, presenting its legal team with many challenges. These range from striking deals for the supply of semiconductors and materials for car batteries to securing partnerships to develop vehicle-charging infrastructure.\n\"Building this alternative supply chain for electric vehicles is a very, very heavy lift that's going to require a lot of legal expertise to implement,\" says Craig Glidden, general counsel at GM. Tensions between the US and China and new laws such as the US Inflation Reduction Act have wide-reaching implications for supply chains and investment.\n\"So much of our business is influenced by geopolitics,\" adds Glidden. As such, he is attempting to recast how his lawyers think, \"to focus on not [just] the case law, but the current events that are actually going to determine the shape of the business in the future\".\n\nMOST INNOVATIVE IN-HOUSE LEGAL TEAMS IN NORTH AMERICA 2023\nWINNER: Liberty Mutual*\nDXC Technology\nEquitable\nGeneral Motors\nHewlett Packard Enterprise\nHoneywell\nIntel\nMicrosoft\nThe Clorox Company\nUpwork\nUber\n* \"Winner\" of the FT Innovative Lawyers award for \"Most innovative in-house legal team in North America\"; other organisations are listed alphabetically\nPressure for change is also emerging from within businesses. \"There is something different about this moment,\" says Damon Hart, chief legal officer at Boston-based insurer Liberty Mutual, winner of the 2023 FT innovative in-house legal team award for North America. \"Legal departments have been able to say 'we're different' and escape some of the scrutiny that other departments have been under,\" Hart adds. \"That's over. Companies are looking at legal like they look at any other part of the business, with the same kind of rigour and [key performance indicators] and metrics.\"\nThat pressure is driving the  growth and rising status  of legal operations roles  in data analysis and other specialisms  which help legal departments apply relevant technology and improve how they deliver their work.\nThis year, the legal operations team at Liberty Mutual launched a programme that pairs its staff with lawyers to improve processes or apply new technologies in specific areas of the business.\nThe goal is to provide answers and equip lawyers with the skills and tools to solve operational problems themselves. \"We take them through steps of design thinking, of agile processes, or what a minimum viable product really means,\" says Kiran Mallavarapu, an engineer by training who leads the team.\nA cultural shift within the team was one of the most pressing requirements to effect change. \"The very first thing we did was create a risk-taking award,\" says Mallavarapu, to recognise \"individuals who either had an idea, raised their hand and said they would contribute, or at least asked the question that made the rest of us think and enabled us to move forward\".\nFor others, handling more complex legal work internally is a strategic and budgeting decision. At ride-hailing platform Uber, chief legal officer Tony West has focused on bringing more substantive work in-house, which he says has helped him retain highly skilled lawyers and is \"significant for professional development\".\nAlso this year, the emergence of generative artificial intelligence has presented a big opportunity to improve legal processes and ease pressure on staff. And, because in-house lawyers are tasked with shaping the so-called guardrails for using generative AI safely, they have a front-row seat from which to observe its development and understand its potential in their own departments.\nAt consumer products group The Clorox Company, associate general counsel Apur Patel is one of two people leading its strategy on generative AI. He describes his approach to using AI as, broadly, \"permissive\". He points out that helping to steer AI implementation means \"[the legal department] gets the visibility we want and we get our hands on the tools\".\nUltimately, many expect AI to reshape not only in-house legal departments but also their relationships with law firms.\n\"I thought that Covid would be an enormous disrupter to law firms' business model, and it really wasn't,\" reflects Hart. \"AI could be that next level of disrupter...the way we use outside counsel will change.\"\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:China should seize the artificial intelligence (AI) opportunities that are set to reshuffle the geopolitical and economic landscape to create a new \"international pattern and order\", according to a report published on Monday by the People's Daily research unit.\nThe development of the \"intelligent internet\"  which integrates the new wave of AI with the traditional internet and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and computing networks  is giving rise to an \"intelligent revolution\", which will lead to deep economic and societal changes, says the research unit.\n\nSoutheast Asian countries are drawing up governance and ethics guidelines for artificial intelligence (AI) that will impose \"guardrails\" on the booming technology, five officials with direct knowledge of the matter said.\nRegulators across the world are rushing to draft regulations to govern the use of generative AI, which can create text and images and is engendering excitement as well as fear about its potential to reshape a wide range of industries.\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:IN 1962 a British political scientist, Bernard Crick, published \"In Defence of Politics\". He argued that the art of political horse-trading, far from being shabby, lets people of different beliefs live together in a peaceful, thriving society. In a liberal democracy, nobody gets exactly what he wants, but everyone broadly has the freedom to lead the life he chooses. However, without decent information, civility and conciliation, societies resolve their differences by resorting to coercion.\nHow Crick would have been dismayed by the falsehood and partisanship on display in this week's Senate committee hearings in Washington. Not long ago social media held out the promise of a more enlightened politics, as accurate information and effortless communication helped good people drive out corruption, bigotry and lies. Yet Facebook acknowledged that before and after last year's American election, between January 2015 and August this year, 146m users may have seen Russian misinformation on its platform. Google's YouTube admitted to 1,108 Russian-linked videos and Twitter to 36,746 accounts. Far from bringing enlightenment, social media have been spreading poison.\nRussia's trouble-making is only the start. From South Africa to Spain, politics is getting uglier. Part of the reason is that, by spreading untruth and outrage, corroding voters' judgment and aggravating partisanship, social media erode the conditions for the horse-trading that Crick thought fosters liberty.\n\nA SHORTER ATTENTION SPA...OH, LOOK AT THAT!\nThe use of social media does not cause division so much as amplify it. The financial crisis of 2007-08 stoked popular anger at a wealthy elite that had left everyone else behind. The culture wars have split voters by identity rather than class. Nor are social media alone in their power to polarisejust look at cable TV and talk radio. But, whereas Fox News is familiar, social-media platforms are new and still poorly understood. And, because of how they work, they wield extraordinary influence.\nThey make their money by putting photos, personal posts, news stories and ads in front of you. Because they can measure how you react, they know just how to get under your skin (see  article  ). They collect data about you in order to have algorithms to determine what will catch your eye, in an \"attention economy\" that keeps users scrolling, clicking and sharingagain and again and again. Anyone setting out to shape opinion can produce dozens of ads, analyse them and see which is hardest to resist. The result is compelling: one study found that users in rich countries touch their phones 2,600 times a day.\nIt would be wonderful if such a system helped wisdom and truth rise to the surface. But, whatever Keats said, truth is not beauty so much as it is hard workespecially when you disagree with it. Everyone who has scrolled through Facebook knows how, instead of imparting wisdom, the system dishes out compulsive stuff that tends to reinforce people's biases.\nThis aggravates the politics of contempt that took hold, in the United States at least, in the 1990s. Because different sides see different facts, they share no empirical basis for reaching a compromise. Because each side hears time and again that the other lot are good for nothing but lying, bad faith and slander, the system has even less room for empathy. Because people are sucked into a maelstrom of pettiness, scandal and outrage, they lose sight of what matters for the society they share.\nThis tends to discredit the compromises and subtleties of liberal democracy, and to boost the politicians who feed off conspiracy and nativism. Consider the probes into Russia's election hack by Congress and the special prosecutor, Robert Mueller, who has just issued his first indictments. After Russia attacked America, Americans ended up attacking each other (see  article  ). Because the framers of the constitution wanted to hold back tyrants and mobs, social media aggravate Washington gridlock. In Hungary and Poland, without such constraints, they help sustain an illiberal, winner-takes-all style of democracy. In Myanmar, where Facebook is the main source of news for many, it has deepened the hatred of the Rohingya, victims of ethnic cleansing.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA, SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\nWhat is to be done? People will adapt, as they always do. A survey this week found that only 37% of Americans trust what they get from social media, half the share that trust printed newspapers and magazines. Yet in the time it takes to adapt, bad governments with bad politics could do a lot of harm.\nSociety has created devices, such as libel, and ownership laws, to rein in old media. Some are calling for social-media companies, like publishers, to be similarly accountable for what appears on their platforms; to be more transparent; and to be treated as monopolies that need breaking up. All these ideas have merit, but they come with trade-offs. When Facebook farms out items to independent outfits for fact-checking, the evidence that it moderates behaviour is mixed. Moreover, politics is not like other kinds of speech; it is dangerous to ask a handful of big firms to deem what is healthy for society. Congress wants transparency about who pays for political ads, but a lot of malign influence comes through people carelessly sharing barely credible news posts. Breaking up social-media giants might make sense in antitrust terms, but it would not help with political speechindeed, by multiplying the number of platforms, it could make the industry harder to manage.\nThere are other remedies. The social-media companies should adjust their sites to make clearer if a post comes from a friend or a trusted source. They could accompany the sharing of posts with reminders of the harm from misinformation. Bots are often used to amplify political messages. Twitter could disallow the worstor mark them as such. Most powerfully, they could adapt their algorithms to put clickbait lower down the feed. Because these changes cut against a business-model designed to monopolise attention, they may well have to be imposed by law or by a regulator.\nSocial media are being abused. But, with a will, society can harness them and revive that early dream of enlightenment. The stakes for liberal democracy could hardly be higher.\n\n\"Minority Report\", a 2002 film directed by Steven Spielberg, features a squad of police officers who arrest people for murders they are predicted to commit. The film was science fiction; yet police departments around the world increasingly use predictive analytics to identify people who might become perpetrators or victims of crime. In \"The Rise of Big Data Policing\", Andrew Ferguson, a former public defender and now professor at the University of the District of Columbia, discusses the promise and perils of data-driven policing.\nThe Economist  asked him about how data and predictive analytics are changing modern policing. After his responses, you can read an excerpt from his book that shows what data-driven policing looks like on the ground.\nThe Economist  : Police have always used data to make decisions. What makes this era different?\nAndrew Ferguson  : Policing has traditionally been reactive: officers respond to calls for service, and experience determines where they patrol. Big-data technology lets police become aggressively more proactive. New data sources coupled with predictive analytics now allow police to visualise crime differently, targeting individual blocks, at-risk individuals and gangs in innovative ways. New surveillance technologies let police map physical movements, digital communications and suspicious associations in ways that can reveal previously hidden patterns of criminal activity in otherwise overwhelming amounts of data. All of this information can be quite useful to law enforcement seeking to track criminal elements in society. The same technology can also be quite threatening to civil liberties and personal privacy in already over-policed communities.\nMore than 60 American police departments use some form of \"predictive policing\" to guide their day-to-day operations\nThe Economist:  How pervasive is the use of tech in policinghow different is the day-to-day work of police officers today as opposed to 20 or 30 years ago?\nMr Ferguson:  Technology is shaping where police patrol, whom they target, and how they investigate crime. More than 60 American police departments use some form of \"predictive policing\" to guide their day-to-day operations. In Los Angeles, this means that police follow patrols based on computer-forecast crime hot-spots. In Chicago, an algorithmically derived \"heat list\" ranks people at risk of becoming victims or perpetrators of gun violence. The result is that police prioritise particular places and people for additional contacts and monitoring. In addition, new surveillance technologiesincluding police body cameras, automated licence-plate readers, Stingray cell phone trackers and high-definition surveillance camerasprovide powerful monitoring tools. All of this technology changes how officers see the communities they patrol and the citizens they police. The technology also changes the job of policing, forcing officers to become data collectors and analysts as they act on real-time inputs and assessments.\nThe Economist:  Does big-data policing work? Has it made people less likely to be victims of crime?\nMr Ferguson:  The jury is still out on effectiveness. The scientific studies are few in number and largely inconclusive. In some cities crime rates have trended down with the introduction of new technologies, but in others there has been no significant effect. Crime rates correlate with a host of economic and environmental forces that make it difficult to demonstrate any causal connection with a specific technology. But really, the benefit of big-data policing for police departments is political. New technology gives police chiefs an answer to the age-old question asked by every politician in every community forum: \"Chief, what are you doing about crime?\" They now have a progressive-sounding, technologically inspired answer: \"We are using a new black-box technology to predict and deter crime.\" Whether it works is secondary to having a response to the otherwise unanswerable (and somewhat unfair) question that every police chief faces.\nThe Economist  : What are the biggest potentials for abuse?\nMr Ferguson  : There are several. First, data can distort policing. Officers sent to an area flagged as being at risk of violent crime may see routine encounters as more threatening, thus making them more likely to use force. Second, the growing web of surveillance threatens to chill associational freedoms, political expression and expectations of privacy by eroding public anonymity. Third, even with the best use policies in place, officers have access to vast amounts of personal information of people not suspected of any crime. Finally, without carefully chosen data inputs, long-standing racial, societal and other forms of bias will be reified in the data.\nThe growing web of surveillance threatens to chill associational freedoms, political expression and expectations of privacy\nThe Economist:  How can citizens best protect themselves from such abuse?\nMr Ferguson:  The time to respond to the threat of big-data policing is now. Every city should have formal written policies in place detailing the approved use of new big-data policing technologies. Every citizen should be educated about the dangers to privacy, liberty and the imbalance of power that surveillance technologies bring. Every police department should engage impacted communities about the risks and rewards of new predictive technologies with official answers to concerns about transparency, racial bias and constitutional rights. Every community should host annual \"surveillance summits\" where the city officials, engaged citizens and police chiefs can come together for a moment of public accountability about the use and potential misuse of new big-data technologies. Education, empowerment, and engagement are the only protections against an encroaching data-driven surveillance state.\nThe Violence Virus\nAn excerpt from \"The Rise of Big Data Policing: Surveillance, Race, and the Future of Law Enforcement\"\nA knock on an apartment door.

Your name is on the \"Strategic Suspects List,\" also known as the \"heat list,\" and a detective is at your door with a social worker and a community representative to tell you the future is not only dark but deadly. A vaccine exists, but it means turning your life around now.\nIn Chicago, 1,400 young men have been identified through big data techniques as targets for the heat list. Software generates a rank-order list of potential victims and subjects with the greatest risk of violence. In New Orleans, Palantir has partnered with the mayor's office to identify the 1% of violent crime drivers in the city. In Rochester, New York, and Los Angeles, similar techniques are being used to identify juveniles who might be involved in repeated delinquent activity. This is the promise of big data policing. What if big data techniques could predict who might be violent? What if a policing system could be redesigned to target those who are at-risk in a neighbourhood before the shooting occurs? This is the theory behind \"person-based targeted policing.\"\nPerson-based predictive policing involves the use of data to identify and investigate potential suspects or victims. Part public health approach to violence and part social network approach to risk assessment, big data can visualise how violence spreads like a virus among communities. The same data also can predict the most likely victims of violence. Police data is shaping who gets targeted and forecasting who gets shot.\nWhile these predictive technologies are excitingly new, the concerns underlying them remain frustratingly old-fashioned. Fears of racial bias, a lack of transparency, data error and the distortions of constitutional protections offer serious challenges to the development of workable person-based predictive strategies. Yet person-based policing systems are being used now, and people are being targeted.\n***\nThere are four main ways in which data and predictive analytics fundamentally change how police in liberal societies operate.\nFirst, big data makes police more proactive. Traditionally, officers might react to calls for service, rely on observations made while on patrol, or respond to community complaints. With person-based predictive targeting, police can instead target suspects for surveillance or deterrence before a call comes in. For local prosecutors, this represents a significant change. As a former head of the Manhattan Criminal Strategies Unit stated, \"It used to be we only went where the cases took us. Now, we can build cases around specific crime problems that communities are grappling with.\"\nSecond, seeing violence as a public-health problem, rather than just a law-enforcement problem, lets societies rethink how best to identify and respond to criminal risk. Violence-reduction strategies in New Orleans, for instance, included social-service programmes. The idea that violence is contagious suggests that it can be prevented. If a good percentage of shootings are retaliatory, then one can design a cure that interrupts the cycle. Every time police summon people whom predictive analytics have identified as potential perpetrators or victims of violence, social-services representatives should be there, ready to offer those young men and women the opportunity to change their environment.\nThird, moving from traditional policing to intelligence-led policing creates data-quality risks that need to be systematically addressed. Intelligence-driven systems work off many bits of local intelligence. Tips, crime statistics, cooperating witnesses, nicknames, and detective notes can get aggregated into a large data system. But the quality of that data is not uniform. Some tips are accurate; some are not. Some biases will generate suspicion, and some informants will just be wrong. An intelligence-driven policing or prosecution system that does not account for the varying reliability and credibility of sourcesand just lumps them all together as \"data\"will ultimately result in an error-filled database. Especially when these systems are used to target citizens for arrest or prosecution, the quality-control measures of black-box algorithms must be strong.\nFourth, other data-integrity concerns may arise when detectives, gang experts, or police intelligence officers control the target lists. While these professionals generally have close connections to the community and valuable knowledge of local gangs and potential targets, risk scores can be manipulated by police interested in prosecuting certain individuals. People can get added to the target listswhich are often riddled with errorswith no way to challenge or change their designation. After all, joining a gang is rarely a formal process; rumour, assumptions or suspicion can be enough to earn an elevated risk score. Worse, there is usually no easy way to get off the list, even as people's circumstances change, time passes, and the data grows stale. The people on these lists, and most impacted by these risks, are primarily young men of colour. This reality raises serious constitutional concerns and threatens to delegitimise person-based predictive policing strategies.\nExcerpted from The Rise of Big Data Policing: Surveillance, Race, and the Future of Law Enforcement.

The company said on Tuesday the product would expand to let readers use the AI tool on websites beyond Google's search engine to summarise longer articles and in-depth information.\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:NEW YORK : Publisher Gannett plans to include generative artificial intelligence in the system it uses to publish stories as it and other news organizations begin to roll out the popular technology that may help save money and improve efficiency.\nBut the largest U.S. newspaper publisher with over 200 daily outlets said it will include humans in the process so that the technology can't be deployed automatically, without oversight. Generative AI is a way to create efficiencies and eliminate some tedious tasks for journalists, Renn Turiano, senior vice president and head of product at Gannett said in a recent interview with Reuters.\nHowever, Turiano added, \"The desire to go fast was a mistake for some of the other news services,\" he said without singling out a specific outlet. \"We're not making that mistake.\"\nGannett is hardly alone in its balancing act. For instance Reuters President Paul Bascobert said in a statement Thursday, responding to a reporter's request for comment about the company's plans, that as the news agency embraces AI technologies, it is \"taking a responsible approach that safeguards accuracy and fosters trust.\"\nMany U.S. newsrooms are grappling with how best to incorporate AI tools that generate new content or data in response to a prompt, or question, by a user.\nBut generative AI's limitations, which include the tendency to \"hallucinate,\" or serve up misinformation with a veneer of certainty, are particularly problematic in an industry that demands accuracy, some experts say.\n\"Where I am right now is I wouldn't recommend these models for any journalistic use case where you're publishing automatically to a public channel,\" said Northwestern University associate professor Nicholas Diakopoulos.\nGannett's strategy reflects the measured approach a number of mainstream newsrooms are taking.\nTheir caution follows well-publicized generative AI gaffes at media outlets including CNET and Men's Journal. Both publications used the technology to generate stories that contained factual errors.\nNext quarter Gannett will roll out a live pilot program using AI to identify the most important points of an article and create bulleted summaries at the top of it. It will launch that feature in the fourth quarter at USA Today. Journalists will have the final say, deciding whether to use what the AI proposed. Gannett will eventually incorporate that summarization technology into its publishing system.\nGannett's journalists are fighting to ensure that they aren't replaced by the technology. Hundreds walked off the job over staff cuts and stagnant wages on June 5. Generative AI is a sticking point in some negotiations with the company, the union said.\n\"The concern other than seeing our colleagues replaced is that we don't believe it's an adequate replacement,\" said Ilana Keller, a journalist at the Asbury Park Press in New Jersey.\nA company spokesperson said its use of AI will not replace journalists, and that it is being used as a tool to help them be more efficient and focus on creating more valuable content.\nLast year Gannett, which has $1.23 billion in debt from its 2019 merger with GateHouse, laid off more than 600 employees. But its cost-cutting has made it profitable.\n'NOT THERE YET'\nAs part of its push, Gannett is also developing a generative AI tool that would take long-form stories and break them into various lengths and formats, like bullet points or captions on photos to create a slideshow.\nTo summarize its stories, Gannett is relying on Cohere, a company that competes with Microsoft-backed OpenAI, which developed the ChatGPT chatbot. Gannett spent two weeks training Cohere's large language model on 1,000 previously-published stories with summaries written by its reporters.\nTo train the model further, journalists from USA Today's politics team reviewed and edited automated summaries and bullet point highlights.\nWhile most news organizations have long relied on some form of artificial intelligence to do things like recommending and personalizing content, new developments in generative AI are reigniting industry interest.\nGannett has also experimented with natural language generation (NLG), a form of artificial intelligence that builds a text narrative around factual data, creating a story. It doesn't \"think\" like generative AI. Journalists review the stories prior to publication.\nOther news outlets are approaching generative AI with varying levels of commitment and caution. The New York Times and the Washington Post are in the planning phase, according to a Times memo seen by Reuters and a Washington Post announcement.\nBloomberg, which competes with Reuters, is developing its own generative AI model, BloombergGPT, which it trained on financial data.\nThe New York Times, Washington Post and Bloomberg declined to provide additional comment on their plans.\nReuters is using AI for voice-to-text transcription to produce scripts and subtitles for video, for example, but it is not publishing AI-generated stories, videos or photographs, according to a May message to staff from Editor-in-Chief Alessandra Galloni about AI guidance for Reuters journalists.\nBBC News Labs, the broadcaster's innovation incubator, is testing whether it can semi-automate the generation of short-form explainers.\nFor those stories, BBC News Labs built a prototype that draws on pre-published pieces of BBC content and uses the ChatGPT-3 model to write it. \"It could never get anywhere near an audience unless a journalist has manually pulled it out,\" said Miranda Marcus, head of the BBC News Labs.\n\"There's a whole other universe of what kinds of stories can we tell with these tools,\" added Marcus. \"But we're not there yet.\"\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:Tsai has repeatedly addressed her government's push to combat Beijing's disinformation campaign, as well as criticism that her strategy aims to stifle speech from political opponents.\nAt a defense conference this month, she said: \"We let the public have knowledge and tools that refute and report false or misleading information, and maintain a cautious balance between maintaining information freely and refusing information manipulation.\"\nMany Taiwanese have developed internal \"warning bells\" for suspicious narratives, said Melody Hsieh, who co-founded Fake News Cleaner, a group focused on information literacy education.\nHer group has 22 lecturers and 160 volunteers teaching anti-disinformation tactics at universities, temples, fishing villages and elsewhere in Taiwan, sometimes using gifts like handmade soap to motivate participants.\nThe group is part of a robust collective of similar Taiwanese operations. There is Cofacts, whose fact-checking service is integrated into a popular social media app called Line. Doublethink Lab was directed until this month by Puma Shen, a professor who testified this year before the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, an independent agency of the US government. MyGoPen is named after a homophone in the Taiwanese dialect for \"don't fool me again\".\nCitizens have sought out fact-checking help, such as when a recent uproar over imported eggs raised questions about videos showing black and green yolks, Hsieh said. Such demand would have been unthinkable in 2018, when the heated emotions and damaging rumors around a contentious referendum inspired the founders of Fake News Cleaner.\n\"Now, everyone will stop and think: 'This seems odd. Can you help me check this? We suspect something,'\" Hsieh said. \"This, I think, is an improvement.\"\nStill, fact-checking in Taiwan remains complicated. False claims swirled recently around Lai, an outspoken critic of Beijing, and his visit to Paraguay this summer.\nFact-checkers found that a memo at the center of one claim had been manipulated, with changed dates and dollar figures. Another claim originated on an English-language forum before a new account on X, formerly known as Twitter, quoted it in Mandarin in a post that was shared by a news website in Hong Kong and boosted on Facebook by a Taiwanese politician.\nChina's disinformation work has had \"measurable effects\", including \"worsening Taiwanese political and social polarisation and widening perceived generational divides\", according to research from Rand Corp.\nConcerns about election-related fake news drove the Taiwanese government last month to set up a dedicated task force.\nIn August, Meta took down a Chinese influence campaign that it described as the largest such operation to date, with 7,704 Facebook accounts and hundreds of others across other social media platforms targeting Taiwan and other regions.\nA few months ago, an audio file that seemed to feature a rival politician criticising Lai circulated in Taiwan. The clip was almost certainly a deepfake, according to Taiwan's Ministry of Justice and AI-detection company Reality Defender.\nChinese disinformation posts appear increasingly subtle and organic, rather than flooding the zone with obvious pro-Beijing messages, researchers said. Some false narratives are created by Chinese-controlled content farms, then spread by agents, bots or unwitting social media users, researchers say.\nChina has also tried to buy established Taiwanese social media accounts and may have paid Taiwanese influencers to promote pro-Beijing narratives, according to Rand.\n\nSINGAPORE: Popular Chinese video-sharing app TikTok has become a political target amid growing fears among governments that China could use it for spying or propaganda, said observers.\nAs the app grows in popularity, and geopolitical rivalry between China and the West remains, worries over privacy and security have been raised.\nIn the past week alone, several top policymaking institutions and governments have  banned the social media app from their devices  .\nThe bans underscore mounting concerns that the Chinese government could use TikTok, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, to harvest users' data to advance its political interests and meddle in other countries' internal affairs.\n\nPRIVACY, SECURITY CONCERNS OVER TIKTOK'S POPULARITY\nThere are concerns over what information is being collected, and whether that is being passed to the Chinese servers, said Dr Kevin Curran, professor of cybersecurity at Ulster University, on the widening pushback against the app.\nThis data could potentially include IP addresses, locations, messages sent within the app, and keystrokes captured from the in-app browser, he suggested.\n\n\"There are fears that TikTok is connected too strongly to the Chinese Communist Party in China,\" Dr Curran told CNA's Asia Tonight on Tuesday (Feb 28).\n\"(And there is a) worry that disinformation could be sown in the future because of the popularity of this app.\"\nOn Monday, the United States gave government agencies 30 days to ensure they do not have TikTok on federal devices.\nHowever, China has said that the  US is overstretching the concept of national security  and abusing state power to suppress foreign companies.\nThe US government's ban on the video-sharing app reveals Washington's own insecurities, said a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson on Tuesday.\nSocial media apps can request \"a lot of permissions, which are quite intrusive,\" said Dr Curran. \"There are also concerns about things that TikTok has, like the in-app browser. This browser could potentially be collecting passwords and usernames typed in and tracking activity on the in-app browser.\n\"So it comes down to whether or not the Western governments trust China not to harvest this intrusive, personally identifiable information.\"\n\nREGULATING THE ONLINE SPACE\nCanada also banned the app  from government-issued devices on Monday.\n\nChanges in the cybersecurity landscape can be driven by geopolitical developments, Ms Hogan-Burney told CNA's Asia First on Wednesday.\nCiting Russia's invasion of Ukraine as an example, she added: \"One of the things that we saw is that the cyber attacks in Ukraine actually began before the ground war.\n\"In addition to that, we've seen, over a period of time, cyber attacks that (occur) just before actions have taken place on the ground as well.\"\nMs Hogan-Burney noted that tech companies like TikTok are concerned about protecting their users' privacy, whether these are businesses or individuals.\n\"I think that everyone else does, which is making sure that things stay secure and private,\" she added.\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:IN 1962 a British political scientist, Bernard Crick, published \"In Defence of Politics\". He argued that the art of political horse-trading, far from being shabby, lets people of different beliefs live together in a peaceful, thriving society. In a liberal democracy, nobody gets exactly what he wants, but everyone broadly has the freedom to lead the life he chooses. However, without decent information, civility and conciliation, societies resolve their differences by resorting to coercion.\nHow Crick would have been dismayed by the falsehood and partisanship on display in this week's Senate committee hearings in Washington. Not long ago social media held out the promise of a more enlightened politics, as accurate information and effortless communication helped good people drive out corruption, bigotry and lies. Yet Facebook acknowledged that before and after last year's American election, between January 2015 and August this year, 146m users may have seen Russian misinformation on its platform. Google's YouTube admitted to 1,108 Russian-linked videos and Twitter to 36,746 accounts. Far from bringing enlightenment, social media have been spreading poison.\nRussia's trouble-making is only the start. From South Africa to Spain, politics is getting uglier. Part of the reason is that, by spreading untruth and outrage, corroding voters' judgment and aggravating partisanship, social media erode the conditions for the horse-trading that Crick thought fosters liberty.\n\nA SHORTER ATTENTION SPA...OH, LOOK AT THAT!\nThe use of social media does not cause division so much as amplify it. The financial crisis of 2007-08 stoked popular anger at a wealthy elite that had left everyone else behind. The culture wars have split voters by identity rather than class. Nor are social media alone in their power to polarisejust look at cable TV and talk radio. But, whereas Fox News is familiar, social-media platforms are new and still poorly understood. And, because of how they work, they wield extraordinary influence.\nThey make their money by putting photos, personal posts, news stories and ads in front of you. Because they can measure how you react, they know just how to get under your skin (see  article  ). They collect data about you in order to have algorithms to determine what will catch your eye, in an \"attention economy\" that keeps users scrolling, clicking and sharingagain and again and again. Anyone setting out to shape opinion can produce dozens of ads, analyse them and see which is hardest to resist. The result is compelling: one study found that users in rich countries touch their phones 2,600 times a day.\nIt would be wonderful if such a system helped wisdom and truth rise to the surface. But, whatever Keats said, truth is not beauty so much as it is hard workespecially when you disagree with it. Everyone who has scrolled through Facebook knows how, instead of imparting wisdom, the system dishes out compulsive stuff that tends to reinforce people's biases.\nThis aggravates the politics of contempt that took hold, in the United States at least, in the 1990s. Because different sides see different facts, they share no empirical basis for reaching a compromise. Because each side hears time and again that the other lot are good for nothing but lying, bad faith and slander, the system has even less room for empathy. Because people are sucked into a maelstrom of pettiness, scandal and outrage, they lose sight of what matters for the society they share.\nThis tends to discredit the compromises and subtleties of liberal democracy, and to boost the politicians who feed off conspiracy and nativism. Consider the probes into Russia's election hack by Congress and the special prosecutor, Robert Mueller, who has just issued his first indictments. After Russia attacked America, Americans ended up attacking each other (see  article  ). Because the framers of the constitution wanted to hold back tyrants and mobs, social media aggravate Washington gridlock. In Hungary and Poland, without such constraints, they help sustain an illiberal, winner-takes-all style of democracy. In Myanmar, where Facebook is the main source of news for many, it has deepened the hatred of the Rohingya, victims of ethnic cleansing.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA, SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\nWhat is to be done? People will adapt, as they always do. A survey this week found that only 37% of Americans trust what they get from social media, half the share that trust printed newspapers and magazines. Yet in the time it takes to adapt, bad governments with bad politics could do a lot of harm.\nSociety has created devices, such as libel, and ownership laws, to rein in old media. Some are calling for social-media companies, like publishers, to be similarly accountable for what appears on their platforms; to be more transparent; and to be treated as monopolies that need breaking up. All these ideas have merit, but they come with trade-offs. When Facebook farms out items to independent outfits for fact-checking, the evidence that it moderates behaviour is mixed. Moreover, politics is not like other kinds of speech; it is dangerous to ask a handful of big firms to deem what is healthy for society. Congress wants transparency about who pays for political ads, but a lot of malign influence comes through people carelessly sharing barely credible news posts. Breaking up social-media giants might make sense in antitrust terms, but it would not help with political speechindeed, by multiplying the number of platforms, it could make the industry harder to manage.\nThere are other remedies. The social-media companies should adjust their sites to make clearer if a post comes from a friend or a trusted source. They could accompany the sharing of posts with reminders of the harm from misinformation. Bots are often used to amplify political messages. Twitter could disallow the worstor mark them as such. Most powerfully, they could adapt their algorithms to put clickbait lower down the feed. Because these changes cut against a business-model designed to monopolise attention, they may well have to be imposed by law or by a regulator.\nSocial media are being abused. But, with a will, society can harness them and revive that early dream of enlightenment. The stakes for liberal democracy could hardly be higher.\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:Scientists in China say their latest  quantum computer  has solved an ultra-complicated mathematical problem within a millionth of a second  more than 20 billion years quicker than the world's fastest supercomputer could achieve the same task.\nThe JiuZhang 3 prototype also smashed the record set by its predecessor in the series, with a one million-fold increase in calculation speed, according to a paper published on Tuesday by the peer-reviewed journal Physical Review Letters.\n\nChina and the United States compete on many fronts, but quantum computing must be among the most exotic.

That is because quantum computing has the potential to be faster and more powerful by many orders of magnitude than the greatest supercomputer in existence.

Some of the weird things that go on down there afford the possibility of doing computing in a new and better way, and of sending messages that cannot be intercepted by an eavesdropper.

It is there that a struggle for primacy is at its fiercest between America, dominant since the second world war, and a resurgent China. Yet the Indian Ocean, relatively neglected until recently, is now having a moment.\nThe economic dynamism of its rim and great importance of the ocean as a hub for trade in goods and energy have long been recognised. Now its strategic significance is catching up. No single power holds sway in this ocean, and perhaps never will. Yet China is making inroads into its waters and other navies also jostle there for influence. A new oceanic era shaped by great-power rivalry has begun. Smaller Indian Ocean countries wonder whether they will be victims of it, or beneficiaries.\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated on January 12th to incorporate news of the American and British strikes on Houthi targets, and more. T  HE OCEANS  matter in geopolitics once more. In the Middle East the Houthi rebel group is menacing shipping in the Red Sea, disrupting global trade. On January 12th America and Britain launched strikes on over 60  Houthi targets  in Yemen. The allies strikes are an attempt to reassert freedom of navigation in a crucial artery of world trade but also dramatically expand the geographic scope of the Middle East conflict. Taiwan stands on the cusp of an election that could shape its future. A fight over the island would involve an intense Sino-American naval war stretching well beyond the Pacific. And in Europe the war in Ukraine may turn on the maritime  contest for the Black Sea  and Crimea. Sea power is back.\n\nIN THE next few days, out of sight of much of the world, the American navy will test the growing naval power of China. It will do so by conducting patrols within the putative 12-mile territorial zone around artificial islands that China is building in the disputed Spratly archipelago. Not since 2012 has America's navy asserted its right under international rules to sail so close to features claimed by China. The return to such \"freedom of navigation\" patrolling comes after a visit to Washington by Xi Jinping, China's president, that failed to allay concerns about the aggressive island-building in the South China Sea.\nChina will protest, but for now that is probably all it will do. The manoeuvres are a clear assertion of America's sea power, which remains supremebut no longer unchallenged. The very notion of \"sea power\" has a 19th-century ring to it, summoning up Nelson, imperial ambition and gunboat diplomacy. Yet the great exponent of sea power, the American naval strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan, who died in 1914, is still read with attention by political leaders and their military advisers today. \"Control of the sea,\" he wrote in 1890, \"by maritime commerce and naval supremacy, means predominant influence in the world; because, however great the wealth product of the land, nothing facilitates the necessary exchanges as does the sea.\"\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:in Chancay\n2  Unlock the Editor's Digest for free Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\nThe once-sleepy fishing town of Chancay, 80km north of Lima, used to be best known as a weekend getaway for residents of the capital. But, today, the beachfront is a sprawling construction site, with cranes shifting pillars as dumper trucks rumble around below.\nThe town is about to become host to one of the largest deepwater ports in Latin America. Construction and operation will be carried out entirely by private companies  something officials say could be a model for other infrastructure works in Peru.\nThe project is so huge it has the potential to upend maritime traffic all along the Pacific coast of South America, displacing it from Chile, Ecuador and Colombia. In its initial phase, the port is expected to handle 1mn containers and 6mn tonnes of loose cargo a year.\nCosco Shipping  , a Chinese state-backed shipping and logistics company, has a 60 per cent stake in the port, with the remainder in the hands of Volcan, a Peruvian mining company. Of the $3.6bn cost of construction, $1.3bn has already been invested in the initial phase, according to Cosco.\n\"The intention of the port is to pull South American countries towards Peru as a focal point [for trade to Asia], taking advantage of our strategic location,\" says Gonzlo Ros Polastri, deputy general manager of Cosco Shipping Ports Chancay Peru and a former admiral. \"It will be an engine for development across several industries.\"\nThe port will sit on a 280-hectare site. The wave breakers alone used enough concrete to construct 20 buildings of 10 storeys and will protect 1.5km of dock space, capable of berthing some of the world's largest cargo ships.\nThe intention is to pull South American countries towards Peru as a focal point [for trade to Asia]\nGonzlo Ros Polastri, Cosco Shipping A 1.8km tunnel bored beneath Chancay  at some points 900m deep  will connect the pier to a logistics centre and the pan-American highway without disrupting traffic in the town.\nCargo will be able to reach China from Peru in 10 days, rather than 45 at present. And Brazil is also expected to be a beneficiary of the port, which will provide quicker access to Asian markets for the country's exports. Brazil and Peru are connected by the Southern Interoceanic Highway, which passes through the Brazilian agricultural hubs of Acre and Rondnia.\n\"There's a whole part of Brazil that looks much more to the Pacific than to the Atlantic,\" says Ros Polastri. \"Chancay has many advantages within Peru, and one is that it is the closest port to Brazil. That's another incentive for trade.\"\nThe inauguration of the megaport is planned for late next year, when Chinese president Xi Jinping will attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit, which Peru is hosting. Cosco says the port will eventually expand. \"The master plan is to have 15 piers, though there's no timeline as we need to see how the port operates in the first few years,\" Ros Polastri explains.\nBut, despite the commercial advantages that officials say the port will bring for Peru, some observers  including US officials  have expressed concern that it could increase Chinese influence on the country's infrastructure.\nMario de las Casas, Cosco Shipping Ports Chancay Peru's public affairs manager, says Peruvian law forbids the use of the port for military purposes without prior approval from the executive branch or Congress. \"Without this preapproval, any such entry would be tantamount to an invasion independently of the ownership of the terminal,\" he notes.\nSome local people have criticised the disruption caused by construction, too, though voters in January overwhelmingly elected a mayor who is openly in favour of the development. \"I think that's a good barometer of where the local population is in terms of acceptance of the port,\" Ros Polastri suggests.\nThe Peruvian government says the port will boost the local economy, and local developers are hopeful. Along the road into Chancay, billboards advertise yet-to-be-built property developments for sale. \"In the area, there are six fishmeal factories and a fleet of around 70 industrial fishing vessels that are the largest source of work in Chancay,\" says Ral Prez-Reyes, Peru's transport minister. \"The project allows the possibility of direct shipment abroad.\"\nPrez-Reyes adds that, while the port will be operated by private companies, the government will monitor their compliance with safety and environmental regulations. Police and customs offices will be built at the site.\n\"The government views the development of ports at the national level in a comprehensive manner, with an effort to provide road or rail access, as well as the logistics infrastructure,\" the minister says. \"These types of investments allow ports to operate more efficiently.\"\nCongress is considering a bill that would allow for cabotage  for cargo to move between Peruvian ports before coming on land  to reduce traffic around the port.\nRos Polastri says Chancay could pave the way for similar private infrastructure projects in Peru, easing progress by bypassing friction between the public and private sectors. The country's decentralised constitution mandates that provincial infrastructure projects be contracted and administered by local government.\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:THE GEOPOLITICS OF the new Arctic entered the mainstream on August 2nd 2007. Descending by  Mir  submersible to a depth of over 4km, a Russian-led expedition planted a titanium Russian flag beneath the North Pole (pictured). The news shocked the world.\nThe Lomonosov ridge under the pole, which is probably rich in minerals, is claimed by Russia, Canada and Denmark. The Russians, it was assumed, were asserting their claim, perhaps even launching a scramble for Arctic resources. One of their leaders, Artur Chilingarov, Russia's leading polar explorer and a Putin loyalist, fanned the flames. \"The Arctic has always been Russian,\" he declared. Yet the expedition turned out to have been somewhat international, initiated by an Australian entrepreneur and a retired American submarine captain, and paid for by a Swedish pharmaceuticals tycoon.\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:LATEST SITUATION\nArab states are working on an initiative to secure a ceasefire and the release of hostages in Gaza as part of a broader plan that could offer Israel a normalisation of relations if it agreed to \"irreversible\" steps towards the creation of a Palestinian state.\nA senior Arab official said they hoped to present the plan  which could include Saudi Arabia formalising ties with Israel  within a few weeks in an effort to end the Israel-Hamas war and prevent a wider conflict erupting in the Middle East.\nArab officials have discussed the plan with the US and European governments. It would include western nations agreeing to formally recognise a Palestinian state, or supporting the Palestinians being granted full membership of the UN.\n\"The real issue is you need hope for Palestinians, it can't just be economic benefits or removal of symbols of occupation,\" the senior official said.\nThe initiative comes as Israel faces mounting international pressure to end its offensive in Gaza, with the US stepping up diplomatic efforts towards a longer term resolution to the conflict and to prevent a broader regional conflagration.\n\nISRAEL'S INCURSION IN GAZA: OCTOBER 2023 TO PRESENT\nIsrael's defence forces launched air and land offensives in Gaza after Hamas's brutal October 7 attack in southern Israel.\nHamas killed more than 1,200 people and seized hostages, according to Israeli officials. The IDF's response has killed more than 24,000 people in Gaza, according to Palestinian officials.\nA temporary truce between the two sides in November allowed for the release of about 105 Israeli women and children as well as foreigners held hostage. This was in exchange for about 240 Palestinian women and children freed from Israeli jails.\nIsrael's military has carried out one of the largest bombing campaigns in history on the small, blockaded enclave. Satellite data shows the toll the war has taken on Gaza's infrastructure and homes, with much of the Palestinian enclave's  two biggest cities in ruins  , including  entire neighbourhoods destroyed  .\nThe IDF's Arabic spokesperson has  posted maps  on social media platform X indicating areas people should flee from and telling Gaza residents to \"keep following the map carefully\". But civilians have struggled to follow the updates due to limited access to electricity and internet connections.\nIsrael's military has been tight-lipped about how many troops it has committed to the incursion  its biggest operation in years. But satellite imagery and tracking data show a significant incursion.\nData tracking the movement of Israeli forces between October 31 and December 31 shows them tightening their hold on Gaza City, surrounding al-Shifa hospital and taking territory in Khan Younis.\nSatellite imagery published from October 31 shows that after  breaching the barrier wall  in at least six places, Israel's columns cut through Gaza's sparsely populated farmland to the south of the border, before moving deeper into the strip towards more populated areas.\nAid agencies have warned about the dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza, including a lack of water, medicine and food. Israel has allowed some humanitarian aid into the strip through the Rafah crossing with Egypt, but the UN's World Food Programme has said people are still at risk of famine.\nThere is also insufficient fuel to keep hospitals and communications networks running after Gaza's sole power plant went offline on October 11 due to a lack of fuel, with the outage captured by night-time satellite imagery.\n\nHAMAS'S ATTACK ON ISRAEL: OCTOBER 7 2023\nAs much of Israel slept, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented, multipronged dawn assault on the country from the Gaza Strip. The Middle East's most powerful security force was caught off guard.\nLaunched on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, the assault began in the early hours with thousands of rockets fired at Israeli towns and cities. The barrage set off warning sirens across the south and centre of the country, sending citizens fleeing to air-raid shelters.\nIsrael's military said Gaza-based militants launched more than 4,500 rockets over that weekend. Many were intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome defence system, but satellite imagery showed fires and plumes of black smoke rising from some locations that had been hit.\nHundreds of Hamas fighters simultaneously attacked by land, air and sea, repeatedly breaching the fortified barrier between Gaza and Israel.\nImages and videos showed motorbikes carrying armed militants riding through a hole in a wire fence along the border and a bulldozer destroying part of the barrier. Bombs, rockets and drones could also be seen blowing up the fence as well as defensive positions.\nMilitants used motorised paragliders to attack the Supernova music festival, not far from the Gaza border, flying in and turning the two-day rave into the site of a massacre.\nGunmen chased young Israelis across the desert, shooting and snatching people to take back to Gaza as hostages. The Israeli military failed to respond for hours, apparently caught by surprise by the attack. Hundreds of bodies have been recovered from the site.\nAfter breaching the Gaza fence, armed Hamas fighters began targeting Israeli communities at several locations, going door-to-door and taking hostages.\nImages and video show people lying dead in the streets after execution-style killings and residents including women, children and the elderly being taken away.\nThe Hamas militants also attacked Israeli military sites.\nMore than 1,200 Israeli civilians and troops were killed, the IDF said  making it the deadliest attack on the country since its foundation.\nThe complexity of the assault by Hamas was unlike anything Israel has witnessed in decades. It raised serious questions about the security service's intelligence gathering and the military's preparedness for an attack.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu imposed a  \"complete siege\"  on Gaza on October 9, calling up a record 300,000 reservists and ordering the strip to be pounded from the air.\nIsrael's military also ordered the evacuation of 42 communities along its northern border, where Israelis have died in cross-border fire that Israel blamed on Hizbollah or Lebanon-based Palestinian factions  part of the Iran-backed \"Axis of Resistance\".\nVisual and Data team:  Janina Conboye  ,  Peter Andringa  ,  Steven Bernard  ,  Chris Campbell  ,  Sam Joiner  ,  Lucy Rodgers  and  Alan Smith\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:\n\nSource:Financial Times\nContent:Business schools keep finding new ways to meet the increasing demands of students  from the use of virtual reality tools on campus to hands-on interaction with companies driving towards sustainability.\nAnd the submissions for this year's Responsible Business Education awards showed a growing emphasis on including sustainability in all aspects of their curricula, a trend most apparent in European institutions. The judges also praised the practical application of simulations by universities to make wider points about the need for a sustainable future.\n\"One of the striking features of the stronger submissions this year was that they featured consortia of schools and colleges of business, collaborating on design and delivery of sustainability programming,\" says Andrew Karolyi, dean at  Cornell  business school and one of the judges. He added that the submissions highlighted how European schools have made \"strategic investments in sustainability-oriented cases, courses, and co-curricular activities earlier than others\".\nEric Cornuel, another of the judges and president of the European Foundation for Management Development, a non-profit network association, highlighted the advances made by the continent's institutions. \"There was a much higher proportion of submissions of exceptional quality in the sample of European schools than in the sample of American schools,\" he says. \"It is possible that a rebalancing in the rankings, in favour of European schools over the ultra-dominant American schools, will accelerate.\"\nThis year's submissions tackled some of the commercial world's biggest challenges, including the promotion of sustainability across all areas of business and innovative ways of addressing the climate crisis. The subjects covered by those shortlisted include climate change mitigation, social entrepreneurship, sustainable transformation, and the link between business leadership and its social impact.\n\nFOCUS ON DOING GOOD\nMadhu Viswanathan, professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, has been teaching for roughly two decades and always tries to place his students in the shoes of the poor. His \"Business for Good\" course, launched in August 2020 for undergraduates, offers an online poverty simulation from the perspective of a 38-year-old woman as she balances money, time, comfort and health for her and her family.\nStudents come up with a business plan to launch a product for low-income customers in local or global markets while still caring about the returns. Viswanathan places a particular emphasis on the relationship between balancing business interests and the environmental and social impact. \"I found the intersection of poverty and marketplaces to be neglected,\" he says.\nHe also notes that artificial intelligence has entered the classroom, and is not going away. While he wants his students to understand the value of generating their own ideas, he says AI can be a useful tool to aid the design of new business models. \"I am a big believer in this technology,\" he says.\nThe judges were impressed with the focus on social impact. They said: \"While this case might be a bit social entrepreneurship heavy, it still represents an impressive breadth and scope of learning and a dynamic approach to the material and its delivery.\"\n\nFIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE\nAcademics have been trying for years to use technology in the classroom in a meaningful way, without much success. But  IE Business School  's use of virtual reality headsets as part of a climate change mitigation exercise caught the attention of the judges. They can see this technology as a tool to enhance learning, although some question whether it is all a \"gimmick\".\nThe use of VR in the classroom is certainly no stunt for Emilio Guillot Ontaon, IE's instructional designer who runs the immersive programme, which is powered by AI. Guillot likens the use of the technology to the introduction of the calculator in mathematics: \"Maths changed from being a hands-on exercise to being more conceptual in understanding what's behind it.\"\nIE's \"Eye in the Storm\" takes students through an \"overwhelming\" journey in the middle of a hurricane using VR headsets. As part of the exercise they must answer crucial questions about climate change.\n\"We want to reignite the conversation about climate change, leveraging this technology that is more engaging than anything else that we might have,\" Guillot Ontaon says. \"Eye in the Storm\" is not confined to a single course but is a flexible module used across various programmes, at undergraduate, masters and corporate levels, he adds.\n\nFINANCE WITH PURPOSE\nWith its \"purpose of finance\" course, the University of Cambridge's  Judge Business School  seeks to challenge traditional ways of looking at finance and make the link between sustainability and the world at large. The academics behind the course  David Pitt-Watson and Ellen Quigley  want students to leave with a more critical mindset.\nThe course departs from the conventional neoclassical approach to finance, which often treats environmental and social sustainability issues as add-ons. Instead, the Cambridge programme starts by exploring the purpose of the finance industry and scrutinises how well it fulfils this purpose  especially in the context of sustainability challenges such as climate change, say Pitt-Watson and Quigley.\nA pragmatic approach to learning is key, they add. The course addresses real-world issues, such as biodiversity loss, to encourage students to think critically about the impact of financial decisions on the environment.\nAn example of their practical approach is a simulation exercise that exposes students to the risks of asymmetric information. They assume roles of fund managers and clients, discovering first-hand how information disparities can affect financial decisions and market efficiency.\n\"A couple of years back, we introduced more explicitly that sustainability must be at the heart of the fulfilment of purpose,\" says Pitt-Watson. \"This, for example, involved the introduction of the perspective of 'universal ownership', which suggests the fund manager should consider systemic issues, particularly climate change.\"\n\nAN AGENDA FOR CHANGE\nThomas Lagoarde-Segot, a teacher and researcher at  Kedge Business School  in France, was instrumental in launching an ecological macroeconomics course in 2019. That followed years in which he focused on the importance of looking at climate and sustainability issues from a macro perspective, rather than business schools' usual emphasis on the micro impact on companies and individuals.\nPartly based on a textbook featuring the contributions of 25 academics, the course revisits concepts of finance and monetary policy from a sustainability perspective. This enables a critical examination of economic and financial factors, such as money, growth and markets, in the context of ecological challenges, and helps prevent greenwashing  a critical need in today's sustainability-conscious environment, says Lagoarde-Segot.\nEndorsed by notable figures such US academic and author Professor Jeffrey Sachs, the course offers a comprehensive perspective on economics and finance. It equips students with the intellectual tools to understand the complex and interrelated issues of sustainability, economics and finance.\nThe course is divided into two parts. The first one addresses topics such as credit, money and interest rates through the lens of sustainability  for example, by interpreting money circulation using the laws of thermodynamics. The second part looks at more micro issues, such as crowdfunding and corporate governance.\n\"We wanted to create a sustainable economics and finance curriculum,\" says Lagoarde-Segot. \"We had to innovate and provide new content. To do that, we had to rely on the pluralism of the various schools of economics thinking.\"\n\nSUSTAINABILITY LEARNING OFF SITE\nStudents at  Vlerick Business School  's European EMBA escape their classroom and visit real companies to expose themselves to the sustainability challenges of the investment world.\nOn site, students have a couple of hours to work out solutions to a corporate problem and then they present their findings to the firm to get feedback. This set-up is similar to providing free consulting to companies  the students apply their learning to real-life scenarios and companies gain fresh perspectives on their sustainability challenges.\nAnother highlight of the course, taught by David Veredas, is the use of the  Financial Times' Climate Game  , a simulation-based learning experience that encourages students to figure out ways to cut emissions to net zero by 2050. \"It is a good exercise for understanding the complexities of decarbonising the hard-to-abate sectors, which paves the way for macro sustainable strategies,\" says Veredas.\nStudents also learn about carbon accounting, the EU's emissions trading system and the voluntary carbon markets. They are taught why it is important for companies to report using carbon accounting and the challenges involved in doing so.\n\"A very important part of the sustainability transformation for companies is to decarbonise,\" says Veredas. To do so, \"many companies are putting an internal price on carbon\". The embedding of carbon emissions in different projects helps companies decide on more sustainable ventures with longer term benefits, he adds.\n\nSource:SCMP\nContent:\n\nSource:Reuters\nContent:\n\nSource:Channel News Asia\nContent:\n\nSource:Economist\nContent:",

    "initial material_facts": "**Out-of-the-box First Layer Projection:**\n\nThe proliferation of decentralized technologies and AI not only reshapes trade dynamics and political discourses but also engenders an unprecedentedly symbiotic relationship between cyber and physical sovereign entities, leading to the emergence of the 'Cyber-Physical Silk Road.'\n\n**Thesis:**\nThe Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), supplemented by generative AI, edge computing, and DAOs, will evolve into a 'Cyber-Physical Silk Road' (CPSR) network\u2014a potent and diverse ecosystem where digital sovereignty aligns with physical infrastructure to redefine global geo-economic interactions.\n\n**Most Likely Outcome and Justification:**\nThe most likely initial impact of DAOs, generative AI, and edge computing on the CPSR will involve the creation of a transmutational economic space where digital revenue streams and new forms of digital governance transform BRI's trade and strategic influence in the Indian Ocean. This novel space is where virtual goods, services, and governance collaborate with and complement traditional maritime and overland trade routes, reinforcing and streamlining economic dependencies across Eurasia and the Indian Ocean.\n\nThis outcome is likely given the current technological trends and geopolitical motivations. For instance, item 14 highlights the BRI's ability to modify trade flows, while DAOs (item 18) offer an innovative governance structure that can be harnessed to enable and regulate these changing economic patterns. Furthermore, the growing prominence of edge computing (item 20) indicates a transition towards more localized and instant processing of data, critical for managing the sophisticated logistics of BRI's sprawling network.\n\n**Detailed Analysis and Impact:**\nThe development of the CPSR will manifest through:\n1. Dynamic Integrative Trade Models: DAOs will facilitate global trade by establishing dynamic, blockchain-powered marketplaces along the Belt and Road corridors. Here, digital currencies like the yuan (item 13) will help overcome currency conversion challenges, and the burgeoning digital economy in China (item 17) will accelerate the trade of virtual goods and services. Statistical evidence reflects this impact through yuan-denominated bond issuances (item 18), representing interwoven financial and digital developments.\n\n2. Political Harmonization: Generative AI will streamline cross-country negotiations and policy formulations within BRI-participating nations by offering accurate and culturally-sensitive translation services. This will ease the consensus-building process on economic agreements, address the predilections of the Indian Ocean's strategic role (item 20), and placate the variations in international perceptions of BRI (item 19).\n\n3. Cultural Interpolation: Edge computing platforms, offering real-time data analytics, will facilitate cultural programs\u2014one of the BRI's soft power tools\u2014by providing localized content and educational materials that enhance cultural exchange along the BRI nations. This will foster a more cohesive regional identity, where cultural integration supports stable economic growth.\n\n4. Reinvention of Sovereignty: As digital infrastructure becomes ubiquitous (item 4), the very concept of sovereignty will evolve, where physical territories are complemented by cyber jurisdictions. This could lead to the creation of 'Digital Free Trade Zones' where data flows freely under the governance of DAOs, aligning with the evolving notions of statehood and territoriality.\n\n**Four Cascading Events in the Chain:**\n\n1. Decentralized Diplomacy: Emerging digital diplomatic channels will bypass traditional methods for conflict resolution and negotiation among nations. Specifically, DAOs will enable a decentralized network of 'digital diplomats' who are algorithms designed to represent national interests and precedents. This will transform international relations, reducing human biases and expediting responses.\n\n2. Cyber-Silk Economic Bloc: Following decentralized diplomacy, traditional economic blocs will increasingly converge with digital alliances, creating a new economic bloc based on the CPSR. This position the region to leverage technological initiatives and secure a dominant stance in the digital economy.\n\n3. Maritime Domain Transformation: The Indian Ocean, as a strategic trade hub, will witness the deployment of automated, AI-powered maritime operations coordinated through edge computing. Smaller Indian Ocean nations may partner with tech firms to adopt these innovations, altering the region's strategic balances and potentially reducing piracy and illegal fishing through enhanced surveillance.\n\n4. Immutable Supply Chain Register: DAO-driven smart contracts and AI monitoring will create an immutable ledger of BRI's supply chains, providing near-perfect traceability and accountability. It would enhance the efficiency of trade, reduce trade disputes, and potentially remove the need for certain forms of trade-related insurance.\n\n5. Formation of a New Virtual Nation-State: The culmination of the digital transformation might give rise to the world's first virtual nation-state built on a DAO structure. This digital entity will engage with physical states on equal grounds, possessing its economy, digital citizenry, and cyberspace jurisdiction\u2014further revolutionizing the global political economy.",
    "force catalysts critic iteration 0": "Here is a detailed critique based on the provided criteria for the Actor's output:\n\n1. Depth of Analysis:\nThe analysis does acknowledge the multifaceted roles of emerging technologies such as DAOs, generative AI, and edge computing. However, the Actor\u2019s depth of analysis is somewhat lacking. The origins of each Force Catalyst in the context of these technologies, such as how countries have historically integrated similar technologies and the evolution of their influence in trade, political discourse, and cultural integration, are not well-articulated. The interconnections between different Force Catalysts, such as how leadership may shape or be shaped by initiatives and entrepreneurship, are not clearly explored either. The analysis needs to dive deeper into how these emerging technologies have grown out of previous advancements and how they relate to each other in driving global change.\n\n2. Balance and Variability:\nWhile the analysis attempts to address all Force Catalysts, there is a noticeable imbalance. Entrepreneurship, for instance, seems to receive less thorough treatment than leadership or initiative. Additionally, the analysis could be criticized for a lack of variability in application; it does not sufficiently contemplate the spectrum of ways these technologies might be utilized by different actors. The one-size-fits-all approach to the potential outcomes of technological integration within the Belt and Road Initiative is overly simplistic. Detailed insights into how these technologies may differently impact developing versus developed nations or democratic vs. autocratic regimes could greatly enhance the thematic richness of the assessment.\n\n3. Validity and Consistency:\nThere are potential inconsistencies in the way Force Catalysts are approached within the analysis. For example, the tangibility of resolve in incorporating technologies could be more effectively linked to specific historical instances where resolve has meaningfully altered the trajectory of integration efforts. Moreover, while the analysis draws connections between leadership and technological progress, it fails to critically examine the validity of such progress against the backdrop of each nation's political landscape. The permutations of leadership and its direct influence on the efficacy of technological adoption weren't properly interrogated.\n\n4. Forward-Thinking and Predictive Analysis:\nThe forward-thinking aspect of the Actor\u2019s analysis is commendable in its acknowledgment of emerging technologies' potential. However, the predictive outcomes appear speculative at times. The analysis would benefit from more concrete data or historical precedents to bolster its claims regarding the future impacts of technologies on the Belt and Road Initiative, or the strategic importance of the Indian Ocean. Predictions need grounding in more than just current trends; they should involve scenario-based forecasting to give credence to the assertions made.\n\n5. Application Breadth:\nThe applicability of the Catalysts is discussed generally across global trade, political discourse, and cultural integration. Nevertheless, the analysis is narrowly focused on specific initiatives and does not adequately consider the breadth of these technologies\u2019 implications across different geographic regions outside the Belt and Road context. The impact these technologies could have on countries not directly involved in the Belt and Road Initiative is an oversight. To broaden its application, the analysis should include parallel initiatives or competitors to the Belt and Road, and bring in a wider spectrum of international actors and regional dynamics.\n\nIn summary, while the Actor's output offers a base understanding of the intersection between emerging technologies and Force Catalysts within key strategic initiatives, it would greatly benefit from a deeper, more nuanced examination of the historical context, a balanced and variable approach to analyzing Catalysts, consistent and valid applications of these Catalysts, predictions rooted in solid forecasting methodologies, and a broader application across diverse geopolitical contexts.",
    "material facts critic iteration 0": "The Actor's analysis provides a comprehensive array of material facts relevant to the underlying question regarding the influence of emerging technologies on global trade, political discourse, and cultural integration.

The Actor identifies a variety of Constraints and Frictions but falls short of pinning down the exact extent to which factors like limited historical precedence and potential bias in data sets impact the accuracy of predictive models. This lacks the quantitative detail necessary for thorough precision.\n2. Frictions such as technological failures or limitations and resistance to technology adoption are mentioned but are not linked to specific, measurable incidents that could shed light on their magnitude and impact.\n3. The ambiguity remains in descriptions like \"organizational inertia,\" which need further elaboration on how they manifest in distinct environments to avoid generalities.\n\nTo improve, I recommend adding statistical indicators, quantifiable benchmarks, or detailed case studies to each Constraint and Friction to bolster specificity.\n\nContextual Relevance:\n\n1. The mentioning of areas such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the Indian Ocean situates Constraints and Frictions within the geopolitical context, but the analysis could be enhanced by elaborating on how these Constraints and Frictions differentially impact the various nations involved.\n2. There is a need to better relate Frictions emerging from social changes to the Belt and Road context. For instance, how might cultural resistance to DAOs specifically manifest in the varied societies engaging with BRI?\n\nThe Actor could strengthen contextual relevance by aligning the discussion of Constraints and Frictions with the nuanced political dynamics and economic strategies of the states participating in these initiatives.\n\nAnalytical Depth:\n\n1. While the Actor looks at the impacts of technological advancements, there's nominal dissection of how these advancements might reshape existing economic hierarchies within BRI countries.\n2. The acknowledgment of legal constraints is surface-level, lacking a discussion on specific implications for international cooperation in emerging technologies.\n3. The analysis misses deeper evaluations of how Cognitive Constraints intersect with cross-cultural negotiations fundamental to initiatives like BRI.\n\nThe Actor should delve into the systemic implications of each Constraint and Friction and how they might instigate broader structural changes or responses.\n\nEvidence and Example Integration:\n\n1. The assessment does not provide substantial evidence to support the listed Constraints and Frictions.

The Actor\u2019s claims need to be supported by data from pilot studies, existing implementations, or historical analogs where similar technologies have influenced trade or political structures.\n\nIntegrating robust, illustrative examples tied to evidence will ensure the analysis resonates more strongly with real-world scenarios.\n\nTemporal Dynamics:\n\n1. The analysis does not sufficiently explore past patterns or the potential evolution of Constraints and Frictions, limiting its foresight.\n2. While emergent technologies are mentioned, there\u2019s little on how past technological adoptions have unfolded over time within related geopolitical scenarios.\n\nIncorporating historical trends and realistic projections for the development of Constraints and Frictions could provide a clearer picture of their temporal significance.\n\nProbabilistic and Scenario-based Approaches:\n\n1. The analysis lacks a probabilistic approach; there are no chances or risks associated with the identified Constraints and Frictions.\n2. The absence of multiple scenarios means there is little to suggest the Actor has considered the broad spectrum of potential outcomes that Constraints and Frictions might yield.\n\nIn response, the Actor should formulate and analyze a range of possible scenarios to capture the complexities and uncertainties each Constraint and Friction could introduce.\n\nIteration and Feedback:\n\n1. There\u2019s no indication that the assessment has been refined based on new information, which is vital as emerging technologies are rapidly developing.\n2. The need for establishing feedback mechanisms is not acknowledged, which would help integrate new insights and react dynamically to changes.\n\nThe Actor should show how iterative approaches and incorporation of emerging data might refine the understanding and management of Constraints and Frictions.",

As entities engage with AI, blockchain, and edge computing, they will redefine power structures, reshape economic paradigms, and recalibrate security postures within the Belt and Road purview and the wider Indo-Pacific domain.\n\nBoth emerging and established global actors must consider an all-encompassing approach that integrates these force catalysts into their strategic blueprints. By doing so, they craft a forward-looking panorama that encompasses sustainable technology adoption, anticipates geopolitical outcomes, and forges cultural solidarity across the intricate and evolving networks of global trade and political dialogue. These considerations, which must remain malleable to the varieties of global and local dynamics, anchor the net assessment of the transformative impact that emergent technology will have on the Belt and Road and the strategic potency of the Indian Ocean.",
    "force catalysts critic iteration 2": "Depth of Analysis:\nThe Actor\u2019s analysis of leadership\u2019s catalytic influence correctly emphasizes the role of leaders in technological integration strategies but lacks a deeper examination of the origin of leadership qualities influencing geopolitical or military dynamics, potentially overlooking historical or cultural factors. For example, the analysis mentions President Xi Jinping's guidance in China but doesn't delve into the historical origins or societal context shaping his approach. Reference to leadership in the context of the Belt and Road initiative could be bolstered by discussing specific decisions and policies that shaped its present state. The Actor should explore a more detailed lineage and evolution of leadership attributes across different regions and time periods to reinforce this dimension of the Force Catalyst.\n\nBalance and Variability:\nWhile the analysis addresses all Force Catalysts \u2014 Leadership, Resolve, Initiative, and Entrepreneurship, it offers limited consideration of their variations within each Force Catalyst. The Actor's assertion that resolved nations must demonstrate adaptability in the face of challenges such as economic coercion could be expanded upon by recognizing different levels and manifestations of resolve in varied geopolitical environments. Moreover, the Actor could improve the variability aspect by presenting case studies where these qualities have differed in expression and by considering how cultural or regional differences can influence the intensity and form of these Catalysts.\n\nValidity and Consistency:\nThe Actor's interpretations of the Force Catalysts show discrepancies in depth and specificity. For example, the analysis states that entrepreneurship influences the economic and social infrastructure of countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative but does not consistently define what is meant by entrepreneurship in this specific context or how it directly connects to these broad outcomes. The Actor should ensure that the descriptions of Force Catalysts are specific and consistent across the board. Additionally, they must defend the validity of their interpretations with examples or historical evidence to make the case stronger and more persuasive.\n\nForward-Thinking and Predictive Analysis:\nThe Actor's closing paragraph touches on the potential future trajectories of geopolitical interactions and economic alliances, indicating an attempt at forward-thinking. However, the analysis falls short in offering logical speculations based on the data presented. A more systemic approach to predictive analyses could include scenario planning that extends the implications of current trends within the Belt and Road and the Indian Ocean context. The Actor needs to ground their speculations in empirical evidence or recognized strategic models to avoid baseless predictions.\n\nApplication Breadth:\nThe Actor\u2019s analysis seems limited in its breadth, focusing primarily on established initiatives like the Belt and Road and Indian Ocean regions. However, there is little mention of how similar dynamics may be at play in different geopolitical contexts or with a variety of actors, such as emerging economies or smaller states. By considering a wider gamut of scenarios and nations, the Actor could demonstrate a more comprehensive applicability of the Force Catalysts. Expanding this breadth to include underrepresented regions or lesser-discussed initiatives could offer a richer, more globally relevant analysis.\n\nIn conclusion, the Actor's work demonstrates some understanding of the Force Catalysts but can benefit from a more nuanced, consistent, and evidence-based approach. Improving depth, acknowledging variability across scenarios, grounding predictions in historical and current data, and expanding the scope to include a broader range of geopolitical contexts would enhance the analysis considerably.",
    "constraints frictions actor iteration 0": "In undertaking an Actor-oriented analysis of the Constraints and Frictions influencing the landscape of global trade, political discourse, and cultural integration through the lens of emerging technologies like DAOs, generative AI, and edge computing\u2014as seen in initiatives like the Belt and Road (BRI) and the strategic importance of the Indian Ocean\u2014one must first recognize that these innovations carry both transformative promise and potential pitfalls. Constraints and Frictions in this context can manifest across multiple dimensions, with pronounced effects on stakeholders at macro and microeconomic scales.\n\n**Constraints**:\n\n*Epistemic Constraints*: Here we assess the limitations on knowledge, especially regarding the comparative effectiveness of emerging technologies in improving trade efficiency or political mobilization. While 80% of AI research may focus on foundation models, the policy-oriented knowledge about the implications of such technologies is still emerging. Intellectual property issues arise in cases such as the conflict between OpenAI and the New York Times, where the safeguarding of copyright can serve as a constraint on open sharing, representation, or adaptation of information critical for full optimization of these technologies' benefits.\n\n*Resource Constraints*: Reflecting on financial and human capital, the Actor's assessment reveals particular attention to the $305.9 billion AI market projected for 2023, an indicator of economic magnitude, which underscores how heavy investments channel toward AI infrastructure development. However, disparities in resources, as indicated by generative AI adoption rates, might inhibit lower-income BRI countries from engaging equally in the trade benefits that AI purports to offer. In this aspect, the yuan-denominated bond issuance worth 125.5 billion yuan reveals the substantial financial resources that countries are mobilizing toward technology-based economic expansion.\n\n*Temporal Constraints*: The strategic long-term planning underscores the gradual progression in AI parameters complexity, expanding from 110 million parameters in earlier models like BERT to the unprecedented scale of 500 trillion parameters envisioned for future models. This trajectory influences planning horizons and necessitates adapting to a progressively digital, interconnected economy, with edge computing aiming to tackle real-world problems in real-time.\n\n*Spatial Constraints*: Geographical factors, such as the strategic importance of the Indian Ocean for the BRI and the immense investments like the $3.6bn Chancay port, allude to the limitations and opportunities that physical space affords. The spatiality of trade routes becomes tightly interwoven with emerging technologies, as seen with predictive satellite data guiding logistics' decision-making processes.\n\n*Cognitive Constraints*: Biases and psychological barriers impose significant constraints; for instance, the AUKUS pact reflects how geopolitical alliances can create predispositions to adopt certain technologies over others, thus shaping the cognitive landscape in which technological acceptance and integration operate.\n\n*Regulatory and Legal Constraints*: New regulations, such as the EU\u2019s forthcoming AI Act, serve as another constraint, classifying AI systems by risk categories and mandating adherence to development and deployment prerequisites. Legal stipulations can both facilitate and impede AI's application in global trade, as seen with the evolving discussions on AI copyright and digital public infrastructure policies.\n\n*Social and Cultural Constraints*: Cultural acceptance of technologies represents a significant constraint. Initiatives like the BRI or the focus on the Indian Ocean necessitate operations within a mosaic of cultures where social norms could either catalyze or resist the integration of technologies such as DAOs, potentially influencing the dynamics of regional cooperation.\n\n**Frictions**:\n\n*Environmental Friction*: The unpredictable shifts in natural environments, such as the maritime conditions along the Belt and Road's sea routes, pose friction to trade continuity. This was illustrated in the historical instance of a Russian-led expedition planting a flag under the North Pole\u2014a symbolic assertion of dominance over a significant trading route, hinting at friction created by competing national interests in the face of environmental challenges.\n\n*Technical Friction*: Failures or unanticipated complications in technology infrastructure can pose significant impediments to the functioning and expansion of the BRI, as reflected in the ongoing debate over the sufficiency of the current transport infrastructure in accommodating increased throughput due to digital trade avenues.\n\n*Human Friction*: The unpredictable elements of human behavior are evidenced by the incorporation of AI in predictive policing, seen in over 60 American departments. While enhancing monitoring efficiency, it has sparked debates over privacy, fairness, and potential racial bias\u2014human friction points affecting societal acceptance and, by extension, usage.\n\n*Organizational Friction*: Resistance and inefficiency within hierarchical structures impede seamless functioning. This is exemplified by the iterative pushback from traditional industries against disruptive AI companies, where friction arises from the incumbent stakeholders\u2019 reluctance to cede market dominance or adjust to new models.\n\n*Informational Friction*: Disinformation and misinformation, particularly through social media, are significant sources of friction that impact civic engagement and international discourse. The spread of AI-generated disinformation could exacerbate geopolitical tensions, thereby influencing the backdrop against which global trade and political interactions occur.\n\n*Political Friction*: The political landscape's unpredictability, as with fluctuating US-China relations, poses friction that can unpredictably impact the BRI's trajectory and the Indian Ocean's strategic alliances. Such friction is evident in trade policies and international relations that are increasingly informed by emerging technologies.\n\n*Economic Friction*: Financial volatility poses real inbound risks to the implementation and operation of technological advancements along major trade routes. Record investments in the yuan bond market, and the strategic pivot to EVs in the ASEAN region all reveal the economic undercurrents that have frictional impacts on technological adoption and their subsequent trade and political implications.\n\nTo validate and further enrich the analysis, statistical indicators and case studies are essential. For instance, the assessment will benefit from concrete data on regional adoption rates of predictive policing technology, showcasing the direct correlations between AI implementation and changes in law enforcement efficacy and community relationships. To amplify contextual relevance, geopolitical dynamics in AI technology adoption should be analyzed, such as the alignment (or resistance) of specific BRI nations to adopting DAOs within their governance frameworks.\n\nIn considering the temporal dynamics, historical precedents such as the development and integration of past transformative technologies\u2014like the internet\u2014can be used to inform a more nuanced understanding of present and future trajectories. The probabilistic and scenario-based approaches are critical for instilling a comprehensive understanding of the potential effects of Constraints and Frictions on the BRI and Indian Ocean region, thus ensuring that assessments encompass a realistic spectrum of future possibilities, complete with risk assessments and mitigating strategies.\n\n**Iterative Approach**:\n\nRecognizing the rapidly evolving landscape of emerging technologies, it's crucial for ongoing iteration in the assessment process. Incorporating real-time developments in regulations, geopolitical alignments, and technical advancements is imperative. Case studies and current event analysis would serve as feedback mechanisms, enriching the assessment and ensuring its relevance and robustness over time.",
    "material facts critic iteration 1": "**Technical Detail:**\n\na. The Actor refers to various instances and evidence of emerging technologies' impact on global trade and geopolitical relations. However, the technical detail surrounding how DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), generative AI, and edge computing specifically contribute to these changes is missing. The Actor should augment the analysis by incorporating details on the mechanisms by which DAOs affect global trade agreements, the specific ways in which generative AI influences political discourse, and how edge computing is integrated into cultural exchanges or strategic military deployments.\n\nb. There are general statements made, such as the development of Meta's \"World Model\" (point 24) and AI's projected economic impact (point 10), but there's a lack of clarity on how these technologies directly reshape global trade or political discourse. The Actor must explain these relationships without assuming reader understanding, particularly regarding the connection to the Belt and Road Initiative and strategic importance of the Indian Ocean. For example, how does edge computing facilitate maritime logistics, or what role does generative AI play in political relations among Indian Ocean littoral states?\n\n**Coherence:**\n\na. Most points made by the Actor appear to be syntactically consistent with no obvious grammatical or syntactical errors. However, points that contain both observable and unobservable elements (points 9, 18, 29, 30) require clearer delineation to ensure syntactic consistency within the dual nature of these facts.\n\nb. No direct contradictions are apparent in the provided points. The points are data-focused and cater to various dimensions of geopolitical and technological spheres.\n\nc. The argument's cohesiveness could be improved by logically connecting the technological trends with the geopolitical strategies and outcomes. For instance, point 25 notes the sophistication of AI models but doesn\u2019t directly connect this advancement to the nuances of strategy and policy decision-making, especially related to trade and politics in the context of the Indian Ocean.\n\nd. While the argument generally makes sense, the omission of direct implications of these technologies in the geopolitical initiatives like Belt and Road needs addressing. There is a big leap from stating emerging technology advancements to concluding their influence on global trade and political discourse without elucidation. The Actor should provide transitions and connections between tech trends and strategic geopolitical initiatives.\n\n**Knowledge Coverage:**\n\na. The analysis seems to miss out on the potential impact of cryptocurrencies and blockchain, under the umbrella of DAOs, on global financial trades and sanctions.

    "constraints frictions critic iteration 1": "**Criticism of Constraints Analysis:**\n\n1. Precision and Specificity:\n    a. The Critic notes a general lack of rigor and specificity in detailing how the epistemic constraints affect the comparative effectiveness of emerging technologies in trade efficiency or political mobilization. For instance, the assertion that 80% of AI research may focus on foundation models is vague and lacks sources confirming this figure or how it applies within the geopolitical context of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the Indian Ocean region.\n\n    b. The financial and human capital under resource constraints need more precise linking to how exactly they inhibit specific countries involved in the BRI from engaging with AI. Assertions on generative AI adoption rates are provided without the necessary backing data to validate the claims.\n\n    c. Lacking explicitness, the report fails to provide clear connections between the described cognitive constraints and the technological adoption patterns.

While the report mentions several constraints relevant to the geopolitical and strategic context, it could better integrate specific examples of how these constraints are directly impacting initiatives like the BRI and the strategic significance of the Indian Ocean.\n\n    b. Frictions stemming from political changes are presented with limited analysis on how these changes impact the adoption and integration of technologies critical to the BRI. For example, US-China relations are mentioned, but the analysis does not delve into how the friction alters the strategic deployment of technologies.\n\n3. Analytical Depth:\n    a. The Analysis lacks depth in exploring the root causes and potential impacts of constraints like regulatory and legal frameworks. The forthcoming EU\u2019s AI Act is mentioned, but without a thorough examination of how it could affect global trade specifically within the BRI context or the Indian Ocean\u2019s strategic landscape.\n\n    b. The report does not delve into the inaccuracy risks that resource constraints might entail for Net Assessment outcomes, nor does it suggest specific mitigation strategies.\n\n    c. The Critic identifies that the report does not provide an in-depth analysis of contingency planning for the identified frictions, which is essential for a dynamic and unpredictable strategic environment.\n\n4. Evidence and Example Integration:\n    a. The report would benefit from including more case studies, such as specific instances where legal constraints have directly affected the deployment of emerging technologies within the BRI framework.\n\n    b. Several times, the Analysis asserts issues such as disparities in AI adoption rates without providing corroborative data or evidence. This needs addressing through rigorously sourced data.\n\n5. Temporal Dynamics:\n    a. The report mentions the temporal evolution of AI model complexity but lacks a broader historical perspective on past technological adoptions, which could inform current and future trajectories within the BRI regions.\n\n    b.

    "constraints frictions actor iteration 1": "In addressing the Critic's feedback, it is imperative to engage in a meticulous and contextually anchored exposition of the constraints and frictions impacting the adoption and integration of emerging technologies such as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), generative AI, and edge computing. These technologies are relevant to global trade, political mobilization, and cultural integration within initiatives like the Belt and Road and the strategic purview of the Indian Ocean.\n\n**Epistemic Constraints**: \n\nThe epistemic constraints in the context of emerging technologies are multifaceted. One concrete example of this constraint is the prevailing uncertainty over the extent of AI research dedicated solely to foundation models. While reports may suggest that up to 80% of AI research is focused on such models, the veracity and applicability of this figure to the BRI context require a closer examination. Within the BRI geography, stakeholders must grapple with the varying availability and reliability of data on current and projected AI capabilities amongst participating nations. Disparities in intellectual capital and research output among BRI participants can lead to unaligned technological expectations and collaborations. For instance, while China is rapidly advancing in large language models, demonstrated by Beijing-based Zhipu AI, other member nations may not have the same level of capability or insight, leading to a misalignment in collaborative efforts.\n\n**Resource Constraints**: \n\nCountries' ability to engage with emerging technologies under the BRI scope, such as implementing AI and quantum computing, is critically dependent on financial and human capital. The relative lags in adopting generative AI can be attributed, in part, to resource disparities between nations. This situation is highlighted by the divergent AI adoption rates; for instance, the AI market is projected to reach $305.9 billion by 2023, experiencing swift growth that some BRI countries may struggle to match due to limited investment in relevant educational and developmental programs. As mentioned in the call notes, the significant cost of cutting-edge technological hardware and the expertise required to harness it imposes a steep entry barrier for certain players.\n\n**Cognitive Constraints**: \n\nRegarding cognitive biases, political narratives influenced by AI technologies could engender predetermined perspectives within and across BRI nations. Cognitive biases impede the objective evaluation of initiatives like predictive policing, where AI-generated analytics are applied, raising concerns over racial bias and data integrity. Cognitive constraints manifest within the Indian Ocean strategic discourse as apprehensions surrounding the obscure and potentially skewed nature of the information proliferated by AI systems, raising the need for discerning evaluation of such technologies' outputs.\n\n**Regulatory and Legal Constraints**: \n\nThe impending EU's AI Act serves as a case in point for legal constraints. Its risk-based approach to AI regulation is poised to create a disparate operating landscape for AI technologies, as BRI participants may be bound by diverse legal frameworks, leading to fragmented policies on data governance, AI deployment, and cross-border digital services. This could result in frictions pertinent to the integration of digital infrastructures and complicate the establishment of legal precedents for new technologies such as DAOs.\n\n**Frictions**: \n\nTechnological frictions are exemplified by political frictions, such as those arising from US-China trade tensions, which can alter strategic investment trajectories and potentially affect BRI's technological initiatives. Adaptation to the US's ideological stance, as seen with restrictions against Chinese tech companies, impacts the global technology landscape's fluidity and could affect the Indian Ocean's strategic role as a conduit for digital and high-tech trade. \n\n**Temporal Dynamics and Projections**: \n\nThe temporal aspect introduces dynamic factors like the evolving geopolitical stance of participating countries\u2014India's potential political stability through the 2024 elections could mean a consistent framework for digital growth and technology adoption in the region, impacting BRI over time. Another temporal factor is the maturation of technologies; DAOs, still in their infancy, may revolutionize business models in the future, reshaping global trade under the BRI framework. A case in point is the potential digital transformation of supply chains underscored by the proliferating Indian Ocean trade routes.\n\n**Scenario Planning**: \n\nA probabilistic and scenario-based analysis would consider several trajectories for how the BRI could evolve under digital technology constraints and frictions. For instance, one scenario could have countries within the BRI accelerating AI and edge computing adoption, possibly facilitated by cooperative regulatory frameworks and infrastructure development. Conversely, a stagnation scenario might emerge due to persistent resource constraints and divergent legal standards, necessitating greater multilateral efforts to align interests and systems. \n\n**Feedback Mechanisms**: \n\nContinuous refinement of this net assessment necessitates iterative feedback loops. As new data on the aforementioned constraints and frictions becomes available, the analysis must adapt. This may involve incorporating additional case studies, such as how the Belt and Road infrastructure projects are leveraging or hampered by AI for logistics optimization, or the consequences of regulatory divergence on AI research collaboration between BRI countries.\n\nIn conclusion, the emergent technologies of DAOs, generative AI, and edge computing carry the transformative potential to recast the contours of global trade, political dialogue, and cultural harmonization, particularly within the geopolitical theatre of the Belt and Road Initiative and the Indian Ocean's strategic significance. An incisive assessment of constraints and frictions, buttressed by specificity, evidence-based assertions, and robust scenario development, is critical to grasping their net implications accurately.",

The points on predictive policing technologies (Point 1), AI and content summarization (Point 2), and the post-pandemic digital infrastructure demand (Point 4), could benefit from more in-depth technical details regarding the specific technologies and methodologies employed, their evolution, and actual impact measurements, beyond the broad and unsubstantiated statements provided.\n1b. Points like the surge in demand for public digital infrastructures (Point 4) could be more precise by specifying which digital services are defined as public infrastructure and how they translate to state sovereignty. Also, Point 19 on AI and automation disruption lacks detailed evidence from the 2020 Future of Jobs Report beyond the broad statement it makes.\n\nCoherence:\n2a. Consistency in the technical language and depth provided across different points needs to be uniform. The level of detail fluctuates which reduces the coherence of the analysis; for example, Point 17 is specific and backed by UNCTAD forecasts, whereas Point 18 is more ambiguous.\n2b. There do not appear to be direct contradictions between the points, but the relationship and relative importance between points can be better clarified.\n2c. Points 9 and 7, which discuss the digital skills gap and productivity gap respectively, do not clearly follow one another in terms of logic flow. There should be a direct link established between advancements in technology and their effects on the economy and workforce development.\n2d. Overall coherence is lacking. Points such as the global GDP contribution from AI (Point 10) and the strategic competition between America and China (Point 11) would benefit from linking to how these factors play into broader themes like geopolitical shifts and trade dynamics.\n\nKnowledge Coverage:\n3a.

Epistemic Constraints:\nThe adoption and research of AI within the BRI nations are often limited by disparities in data availability and granularity. Data collection methods vary, with discrepancies in qualitative and quantitative measures affecting analytics. For instance, the reliability of large language models necessitates extensive data, but the availability and standardization of such data in participating BRI nations vastly differ. The comparison of data quality standards between countries such as Pakistan and Singapore exhibits considerable divergence, querying fundamentally the extrapolation of AI research findings from one BRI context to another.\n\n2. Resource Constraints:\nSpecific BRI nations demonstrate stark differences in financial and human capital allocation toward technological advancement. For example, resource allocation in China's AI sector, backed by extensive government subsidies, exceeds that of smaller economies such as Tajikistan. This divide is reflected in the differential adoption rates of technology. The cost of AI hardware and computational resources provides a tangible barrier: countries like Singapore can afford edge computing infrastructures, whereas others might prioritize investment within extant capabilities due to financial constraints.\n\n3. Cognitive Constraints:\nThe phenomenon of predictive policing illustrates cognitive biases, with Ferguson's study indicating existing prejudices in data inputs leading to disparate treatment of marginalized communities. Concretely, in minority neighborhoods within BRI nations, predispositions in algorithmic predictions may exacerbate existing societal disparities, not unlike issues faced in Chicago's deployment of predictive policing.\n\n**Contextual Relevance:**\n\n1. Regulatory and Legal Constraints:\nThe BRI's regulatory mosaic demands an analysis of legal frameworks, specifically how nations like Laos or Myanmar integrate novel AI laws with traditional legal principles. The ASEAN plans for AI governance provide a framework yet vary in enforcement and interpretation compared with regions' geopolitical narratives like the EU's AI Act. The legal cultures in the BRI, with varying degrees of receptive capacity for regulatory interoperability, pose nuanced challenges in creating a harmonious digital trade route.\n\n2. Technological Frictions:\nStrategically, friction within the Indian Ocean region manifests in technological disruptions to navigational systems, such as GPS spoofing incidents, affecting maritime trade routes.

Such examples underscore the importance of aligning resource constraints with long-term national technological agendas.\n\n**Evidence and Example Integration:**\n\n1. Technological Integration Across the BRI:\nChina's development and deployment of large language models, like Zhipu AI, stand as a case study showing high-impact technological integration. However, contrasting the uptake of similar technologies in other BRI nations like Kazakhstan exposes a nuanced picture with economic analyses indicating that disparities in hardware affordability and the necessary skilled workforce are critical hindering factors.\n\n2. Hardware Cost Disparities:\nAn in-depth economic analysis might reveal that the cost of cutting-edge hardware suitable for advanced AI learning tasks acts as a gatekeeper. For instance, when comparing the procurement costs of such hardware by BRI members like China and its Central Asian counterparts, it becomes clear that disparities in fiscal capacity can prove prohibitive.\n\n**Temporal Dynamics:**\n\n1. Maturity of DAOs:\nThe evolution of DAOs showcases their potential to impact trade within the BRI, with recent years witnessing their experimental integration into logistics for coordinating supply chain functions with greater transparency and efficiency. This is transformative given the historical reliance on standard corporate structures which, in contrast to DAOs, necessitate centralized governance susceptible to corruption and inefficiency\u2014a significant issue in regions like the Indian Ocean.\n\n2. Past Technological Transitions:\nDrawing from historical context, the transition to wireless telegraphy in the early 20th century reshaped maritime communication, mirroring today's transformative leap with emerging technologies such as edge computing in the maritime domain. These lessons from history inform our understanding of how similarly seismic changes, like the integration of generative AI in international diplomacy and cultural integration, could unfold within the BRI effort.\n\n**Probabilistic and Scenario-based Approaches:**\n\n1. Scenario Construction:\nWhen constructing scenarios addressing constraints and frictions, it is paramount to consider both constructive and deleterious outcomes. For example, while generative AI might foster enhanced cultural understanding between BRI nations, there is also a potential for increased dissemination of state-sponsored misinformation, with a broad range of outcomes requiring detailed scenario frameworks.\n\n2. Probabilistic Modeling:\nA probabilistic model might predict the variable integration of DAOs in global trade policy among BRI nations, accounting for legal variabilities and the readiness of digital infrastructure within each nation. The likelihood census can range from high-probability, low-impact outcomes like slow DAO adoption due to bureaucratic inertia, to low-probability, high-impact scenarios such as rapid DAO incorporation causing radical shifts in regional trade dynamics.\n\n**Iteration and Feedback:**\n\n1. Continuous Integration:\nRegular assessment cycles, potentially bi-annual, would enable dynamic incorporation of fresh data, such as new AI impact metrics or emerging geopolitical alliances, to maintain an updated net assessment. This could ensure that evolving technologies like edge computing are consistently evaluated within the changing geopolitical context.\n\n2. Feedback Mechanisms:\nCross-validation through regional stakeholder engagement forums or collaborations with technology think tanks can provide the necessary feedback, ensuring that strategic initiatives like the BRI remain attuned to the latest technological implementations and are in step with digital environment progressions.\n\nThe iterative precision, deep contextual focus, and robust evidence-based approach in assessing these emerging technologies must be imbued with a strong appreciation of historical context and a forward-looking, scenario-based strategic framework to provide comprehensive insights for stakeholders involved in the Belt and Road Initiative and affected by the strategic importance of the Indian Ocean region.",

Possibilities and Relevant Information:\nThe Actor has undertaken a broad analysis of the most likely outcomes concerning the integration of DAOs, generative AI, and edge computing with regard to the BRI and the Indian Ocean. However, the focus on positive outcomes such as increased efficiency and collaboration neglects potential negatives like cybersecurity risks, resistance due to technological unemployment, and geopolitical pushback due to perceived hegemony. These topics need to be integrated to consider all possibilities comprehensively.\n\nb. Misinterpretation Correction:\nWhile the Actor uses current trends to predict outcomes \u2013 such as India's digital prowess and AI\u2019s influence on elections \u2013 there is no mention of recent tensions between India and China that could influence initiatives such as the BRI. An adjustment to incorporate these geopolitical elements could provide a more balanced projection.\n\n**Technical Detail:**\n\na. Technical Adequacy:\nThe projection summarizes the technologies and their generic effects on trade, political discourse, and cultural integration yet lacks the technical specifics of how DAOs or generative AI will specifically interface with existing systems within the BRI framework, or how edge computing will address the precise needs along the Indian Ocean trade routes.\n\nb. Inclusion of Necessary Information:\nThe analysis would benefit greatly from incorporating statistics or case studies that exemplify the current state of technology adoption within the BRI countries or the Indian Ocean region. How have these technologies advanced in practice to date within participating countries?\n\n**Logical Coherence:**\n\na. Syntactic Consistency:\nThe Actor's projection maintains logical flow but could benefit from more explicitly linking technologies with specific aspects of the BRI and Indian Ocean strategic context.\n\nb. Coherence and Justification of Assertions:\nThe Actor assumes technological adoption will invariably result in positive outcomes, such as cultural synergy. This projection needs to explore and justify other plausible scenarios, such as cultural dissonance due to homogenization or rejection of technology based on local context.\n\n**Analytical Depth:**\n\na. Depth of Implications:\nThe Actor brushes over the implications of these technologies on the power dynamics within the BRI and the Indian Ocean region.

    "first layer actor iteration 0": "In scrutinizing the transformative impact of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), and edge computing on global trade structures, political dynamics, and the cultural tapestry, it's crucial to dissect and interpret these technological trends within the nuanced scope of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the strategic significance of the Indian Ocean. Such a comprehensive analysis traverses the multiple layers of direct and indirect technological influences, potential recursive effects, and multifarious trajectory scenarios relevant within the mentioned contexts.\n\n**Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and the BRI:**\n\nDAOs are cutting-edge blockchain constructs that redefine organizational governance and decision-making through decentralized ledger technology. Their promise lies in the democratization of trade and investment processes, potentially mitigating bureaucratic inertia and enhancing the efficiency of transnational commercial transactions. Within the framework of the BRI, DAOs could forge a transformative path by enabling an unprecedented level of transactional transparency and collective decision-making through smart contracts.\n\nOne plausible scenario involves DAOs facilitating seamless collaborations among BRI stakeholders, optimizing resource allocation, and driving equitable profit-sharing mechanisms. Conversely, one must consider the potential friction DAOs might encounter due to entrenched regulatory and geopolitical interests. Additionally, the technological literacy and infrastructure readiness among participant nations will be variably stringent markers of DAOs' efficacy.\n\n**Generative AI and Political Discourse:**\n\nThe introduction and propagation of generative AI, such as OpenAI's GPT series, bear significant ramifications on information dissemination and political intermediation. These AI-driven platforms can craft intricate media endowed with compelling narratives at an unparalleled pace, deeply resonating within the political spheres of BRI-associated nations. Generative AI's utility extends to strategic communication campaigns, driving public support, and possibly forging socio-political consensus on pivotal BRI directives.\n\nNevertheless, a critical speculative scenario arises from the susceptibility of generative AI systems to propagate biased or manipulated content, inadvertently causing informational distortions with far-reaching implications for democratic processes within the BRI landscape. Additionally, there's a persistent risk of systemic biases solidifying pre-existing societal stratifications and potentially fostering unrest due to unequal representation and voice.\n\n**Edge Computing and Cultural Integration:**\n\nEdge computing's diffusion as a cornerstone technology in managing voluminous data proximate to its origin can catalytically hasten real-time analytical processes, including cultural data interpretation and language translation. For the BRI and Indian Ocean geopolitical contours, edge computing could serve as the backbone infrastructure propelling cross-cultural engagement and multilateral diplomacy.\n\nA notable projection here lies in edge-computing-enabled communication networks streamlining maritime operations and surveillance in the Indian Ocean, thus bolstering both trade logistics and regional security. Conversely, real-time data processing and AI-driven automation risk precipitating labor market attrition across BRI-participant nations, ushering in socio-economic transformations requiring meticulous forward-planning and responsive remedial strategies.\n\nTo establish the viability of emerging technologies within the specified geopolitical and trade contexts, framed projections, with timelines and conditionality indicators, are necessary. For example, the adoption of DAOs could be envisaged to gain credible traction in the BRI context by 2025, contingent upon cooperative policy harmonization among participating states, with the proliferation of generative AI and edge computing postulated to follow suit, although potentially tempered by regional readiness and normative frameworks.\n\nIn parallel, it is imperative to stress that comprehensive risk assessments accompany such projections, where strategic countermeasures are formulated to uphold the integrity of digital governance, ensure employment stability during tech-induced market evolutions, and mitigate potential exacerbation of power asymmetries. In breaking down projected outcomes across short (1-2 years), medium (3-5 years), and long-term (5+ years) horizons, stakeholders receive a blueprint of technology appropriation \u2013 one punctuated with critical signposts such as reinforced data privacy laws, diversification of labor skills, and augmentation of cross-cultural knowledge transfer protocols.\n\nIn totality, while DAOs, generative AI, and edge computing stand as harbingers of a potentially synergistic era for the BRI and the Indian Ocean region's strategic tableau, their full spectrum integration necessitates conscientious and holistic net assessments, actively cognizant of regional singularities, potential adversities, and a forward-leaning trajectory bench-marked against pragmatic, real-world evaluations.",

Within the rubric of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the pivotal locus of the Indian Ocean, the import of these technologies amplifies, bearing cascading and nuanced implications worthy of meticulous exploration.\n\n**Precision and Specificity:**\n1. DAOs, with their decentralized ledger system, are poised to streamline multinational trade operations within the BRI by ensuring transparent, democratic decision-making and potentially reducing bureaucratic hurdles. However, the implementation of DAOs also raises critical regulatory concerns. For instance, without appropriately adopted monitoring and legal frameworks, DAOs can be susceptible to malfeasance, such as money laundering or unauthorized trading, illustrating the double-edged nature of this innovation. The analysis must accentuate a full scope of DAOs, including potential for misuse and the development of necessary regulatory guardrails to negotiate these risks.\n\nGenerative AI has the capacity to reshape political discourse by fabricating sophisticated content, thereby swaying public opinion across the geographies connected by the BRI. Generative models, such as the GPT series by OpenAI, facilitate communication beyond language barriers but present the risk of disseminating biased or manipulated narratives. The variegations in regulatory responses across the BRI and the Indian Ocean region, such as in China\u2019s AI governance framework compared to ASEAN's approach, need to be outlined with greater clarity to map the technopolitical landscape genuinely.\n\n2. Edge computing is catalyzing shifts in the strategic significance of the Indian Ocean by enhancing maritime domain awareness through the localized processing of sensor data. This decentralization of data processing could enable real-time analytics, optimize maritime logistics, and reinforce security initiatives. Such transformative capabilities necessitate not only technical exposition but also deeper exposition into their ripple effects on the regional security apparatus and broader geopolitical relations.\n\n**Logical Coherence:**\nThe holistic impact of these technologies on socio-economic stratifications within participatory BRI nations remains to be more lucidly convened, necessitating an analytical trajectory that considers the interplay between technological accessibility, economic empowerment, and stratification. This is emergent in the digital divide observed across different economic strata and nations, implicating access to technology as a potential cause of widening disparities. Furthermore, the likelihood of regulatory frictions in DAOs' operations due to national interests must be substantiated with scenarios indicative of geopolitical tensions.\n\n**Analytical Depth:**\nThese technologies' impacts transcend their immediate applications, branching into indirect effects such as reshaping labor markets, perturbing economic equilibriums, and necessitating nuanced cultural accommodations. It is essential to contemplate these broader implications, discerning how, for example, generative AI might influence labor demands or how DAOs could cultivate novel economic paradigms within the BRI paradigm. An incisive understanding of these ripple effects will afford stakeholders a more formidable grasp on the shifting sands of geopolitical and economic realities tied to these technologies.\n\n**Biases:**\nThere must be an equilibrium in weighing the boons and banes of emerging technologies. This analysis must broaden to include cases where the adoption of DAOs, generative AI, or edge computing could lead to negative outcomes such as increased surveillance, loss of privacy, or steepening inequality. By tempering optimistic outlooks with critical examinations of potential pitfalls, a more balanced view is obtained that eschews overzealous tech evangelism.\n\n**Usage of Evidence and NA Prep Points:**\nEvidence should serve as the bedrock to underpin every claim; to that end, the analysis of DAOs can be strengthened by referencing specific case studies exemplifying their impact on international trading practices, delineating how generative AI's evolution is correspondingly molding political narratives, and applying existing data on edge computing's efficacies in maritime surveillance. Concretizing these points with empirical examples and contemporary data will serve to enhance the solidity of the projected assessment.\n\n**Concluding Impacts:**\nEmerging technologies are not isolated agents; they are interwoven within the existing fabric of economic, political, and social infrastructures. Thus, in answering the question wholly, it is necessary to articulate a summative interpretation, crosslinking the individual technological impacts to paint a composite picture, inclusive of economic ramifications, political recalibrations, and cultural realignments within the BRI context and Indian Ocean strategic import.\n\n**Cascading Impacts:**\nAssessing the cascading impacts necessitates projecting these technological paradigms' enrollments into the future state of the regional hierarchy and diplomatic interfacing. For example, it is incumbent upon the analysis to contemplate how DAOs may redefine trade partnership trust levels or how the ubiquitous nature of generative AI may recalibrate informational hegemonies. In tandem, the spatially bound benefits of edge computing on regional security and response time in the Indian Ocean region need to be unpicked.\n\n**Actionable Insights and Tangible Benefits:**\nThe culmination of this analysis should be poised towards forging actionable trajectories. For instance, the implementation of DAOs within BRI's trade infrastructure could be complemented with recommendations for establishing an intergovernmental consensus on regulatory best practices. Similarly, for generative AI, practical guidelines may be posited for creating cross-border agreements on data sovereignty and common standards to counter misinformation. As for edge computing, strategic policy development for real-time shipping route surveillance in the Indian Ocean should be laid out, informed by the projection of near-term maritime security enhancements.",
    "first layer critic iteration 2": "**Precision and Specificity:**\n\n1. The Actor's analysis touches on DAOs' potential to streamline multinational trade operations but lacks specific case studies from BRI nations to show practical applications or pilot projects. Future iterations should provide real-world examples, such as DAO-based smart contracts in cross-border trade within the BRI to demonstrate tangible impacts.\n\n2. The discussion on generative AI must go beyond the risks of disseminating manipulated narratives to include specific instances of how generative AI has influenced political discourse in BRI nations. By analyzing distinct policy decisions influenced by AI-crafted narratives, the Actor could show direct causality and offer more pointed insights.\n\n3. While the analysis emphasizes edge computing's positive contributions to maritime domain awareness, it falls short in accounting for its potential to disrupt labor markets or infringe on the sovereignty of nations via unregulated data harvesting. Detailing broader implications with concrete examples would provide a more balanced view.\n\n**Logical Coherence:**\n\n1. The Actor identifies technologies' sociopolitical impacts but does not thoroughly interconnect these aspects. An examination of how DAOs might shift power dynamics within BRI nations or lead to new forms of digital diplomacy among Indian Ocean states could reveal the intertwined nature of these influences.\n\n2. There's a lack of coherent argumentation on how different nations might respond to regulatory frictions posed by DAOs, especially given varying national interests. The Actor needs to link the adoption of DAOs to specific geopolitical tensions and offer scenarios reflecting possible outcomes.\n\n**Analytical Depth:**\n\n1. Analytical depth is somewhat shallow regarding indirect effects, such as labor market disruptions caused by generative AI. Delving into specific sectors within BRI nations that may be affected and the cultural accommodations necessitated by these changes could add depth to the analysis.\n\n2. The Actor postulates broad cultural realignments but doesn't sufficiently explore how the technological paradigm might catalyze such shifts. Incorporating case studies on cultural exchange or friction facilitated by generative AI within the BRI could enrich the analysis.\n\n**Biases:**\n\n1. The analysis has an optimistic bias towards the benefits of emerging technologies without adequately addressing the negative repercussions, such as increased surveillance by state actors using edge computing. A more balanced approach that critically examines potential negatives is needed.\n\n2. There is an inherent bias in considering the strategic value of the Indian Ocean predominantly through a security lens, potentially overlooking significant environmental and cultural aspects that need to be addressed in relation to emerging technologies.\n\n**Usage of Evidence and NA Prep Points:**\n\n1. The Actor must justify the claim that DAOs will lead to democratic decision-making in multinational trade operations. Presenting evidence from current DAO practices or BRI projects could substantiate this point.\n\n2. When speculating about generative AI's use in fabricating content, the Actor should reference specific instances where this has occurred within the BRI context, thereby grounding assertions in evidence.\n\n**Concluding Impacts:**\n\n1. The Actor closes with broad suggestions for actionable steps but leaves a gap in usability by not providing a detailed pathway or timeline for the recommended actions. It falls on them to breakdown implementation steps in stages and cite specific actors responsible for driving these changes.\n\n2. The conclusion mentions \"strategic policy development\" but doesn't precisely address who should undertake these policies, how the process should be initiated, and what a successful outcome would look like within BRI nations and the Indian Ocean region.\n\n**Cascading Impacts:**\n\n1. The Actor discusses the potential benefits of emerging technologies but does not include all cascading impacts, nor do they state which scenarios are the most likely. They should address potential issues, such as how rapid technological changes could exacerbate the digital divide and lead to sociopolitical instability.\n\n2. The Actor misses the triggers for events such as regulatory changes required for DAOs to be adopted within BRI nations. It is crucial to identity conditions that could lead to one scenario over another, enhancing the actionability of the analysis.\n\n**Actionable Insights and Tangible Benefits:**\n\n1. The recommendations provided are somewhat generic and lack detailed, tangible benefits for decision-makers. For stronger actionability, the Actor should specify who precisely can act on the insights, such as a particular BRI country's trade department, and outline explicit steps they must take.\n\n2. While the Actor correctly identifies emerging technologies' varying impacts, they need to pinpoint with greater detail the \"when\" and \"what.\" They should propose a clear timeline for the development of DAOs and edge computing within the BRI context, and identify the milestones for implementation.\n",
    "first layer actor iteration 2": "Emerging technologies such as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), generative AI, and edge computing are significantly reshaping the global landscape, affecting various facets of human existence including trade, political discourse, and cultural integration. These technologies hold particular implications for transnational initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the strategic dynamics of the Indian Ocean. A nuanced exploration reveals both their transformative potential and the challenges they might pose within these contexts. \n\n**DAOs and Global Trade in BRI Context:**\n\nDAOs propose a radical rethinking of organizational structures and governance mechanisms, which is particularly relevant in the context of the BRI's expansive network that spans diverse legal and regulatory environments. For example, a DAO established to manage a joint infrastructure project between BRI participating countries could democratize decision-making and enhance policy coherence by encoding agreed-upon rules and processes within smart contracts. This would potentially mitigate disputes and streamline execution, fostering successful multinational collaborations.\n\nCase studies such as the utilization of DAOs in managing cross-border logistics operations could serve as empirical demonstrations of their practical applications within the BRI framework. The potential for DAOs to harness blockchain technology in ensuring supply chain transparency and automation could revolutionize trade practices, circumventing traditional barriers and inefficiencies, ultimately leading to a more synchronized and resilient trade mechanism.\n\nHowever, these optimistic scenarios are contingent on overcoming multifaceted challenges, such as finding a consensus on the interoperability of blockchain systems among BRI countries and addressing concerns regarding data sovereignty and regulatory compliance. Practical applications, such as the DAO-governed digital silk road, aimed at decentralizing commerce and finance across the BRI, are still in developmental stages. Therefore, while their theoretical benefits to trade are considerable, their concrete implementation faces significant hurdles that must be acknowledged and addressed.\n\n**Generative AI Influencing Political Discourse:**\n\nThe deployment of generative AI in the field of communication offers a powerful tool for crafting political narratives and influencing public opinion. This technological marvel can generate highly persuasive and targeted content, potentially swaying electoral outcomes or affecting policy decisions within BRI nations. Historical evidence shows varying degrees of impact from generative AI, ranging from subtle shifts in political leaning to overt propaganda.\n\nA pertinent example involves AI-crafted information campaigns that seek to engender support or opposition to key BRI projects. There have been instances where generative AI has been employed to fabricate narratives that align with certain geopolitical interests, illustrating an aspect of political discourse manipulation. This raises ethical questions regarding the use of AI in political messaging, underscoring the need for transparency and mitigation measures to prevent the distortion of democratic processes.\n\nGenerative AI's influence on political discourse is fraught with potential for misuse, demonstrating the need for a robust discussion on ethical frameworks and international regulations. Ensuring that generative AI serves the public interest within BRI regions will likely necessitate concerted efforts across the technological, policy and legislative domains.\n\n**Edge Computing and Cultural Integration:**\n\nEdge computing's potential to significantly improve real-time data processing capabilities has implications for cultural integration and diplomatic relationships among Indian Ocean states. Smart maritime surveillance systems, driven by edge computing, could facilitate safer navigation, enhance environmental monitoring, and support disaster response efforts.\n\nFor instance, the deployment of edge computing in maritime domain awareness systems by Indian Ocean littoral states could foster trust and technical cooperation, contributing to regional stability and the protection of vital trade routes. However, the adoption of edge computing must be carefully managed to respect national sovereignty, address labor concerns, and ensure that data collected in one state's territorial waters is not exploited by another without consent.\n\nThe increased reliance on technologies for cultural exchange may also lead to concerns about digital colonialism, where more technologically advanced nations exert undue influence over the cultural and economic systems of less developed states. It is thus critical for culturally sensitive and equitable frameworks to be developed that consider the technological capacities and priorities of all involved nations.\n\n**Cascading Impacts and Actionable Insights:**\n\nThe cascading impacts of these technologies go beyond their direct applications. For instance, the widespread use of DAOs could disrupt traditional business practices and create new economic opportunities, but might also result in governance challenges and legal ambiguities that require careful examination. Similarly, while generative AI may enable enhanced communications and the efficient dissemination of policy, its potential role in misinformation and disinformation campaigns poses risks to the integrity of political systems.\n\nIdentifying the most likely scenarios and their triggers is essential for actionable insights. In the context of the BRI, it would be prudent to assess the readiness and technological infrastructure across different nations to adopt DAOs, understanding the regulatory landscape and identifying key stakeholders who can facilitate or hinder these shifts. Similarly, forecasting the development of edge computing within crucial sectors like maritime security and trade logistics, while providing a comprehensive risk analysis and strategies for mitigation, could guide policy development and investment strategies.\n\n**Conclusion with Precise Time Frames and Indicators:**\n\nTo provide stakeholders with actionable insights, it is crucial to put forth a clear timeline with policy recommendations, and identify indicators for tracking technological adoption and geopolitical influence. For example, within the next 3-5 years, BRI nations should prioritize establishing common standards for DAOs to ensure seamless integration into their mutual trade systems. Generative AI, in the same timeframe, should be subjected to international regulatory frameworks that balance innovation with ethical use, potentially spearheaded by BRI member states' collaborations.\n\nIn the Indian Ocean, edge computing could be implemented in smart port systems within the next 1-2 years, with projects starting in leading ports of strategically placed countries like Singapore and Malaysia, based on secured funding and technology partnerships. Attention should be paid to indicators such as the rate of technological infrastructure investments across the region, and the progression of international agreements governing the collaborative use of edge computing systems.\n\nIn conclusion, emerging technologies like DAOs, generative AI, and edge computing are at the forefront of transforming the global landscape of trade, politics, and culture, especially in regards to the Belt and Road Initiative and the Indian Ocean's strategic significance. These technologies promise to redefine how we conduct trade, engage in political dialogue, and integrate diverse cultures, while at the same time presenting formidable challenges that warrant a cautious yet optimistic approach to harnessing their full potential.",

Each of the suggestions provided aims to catalyze the Actor\u2019s improvement on these fronts.",
    "first layer actor iteration 3": "In the evolving landscape of global trade, political discourse, and cultural integration, emerging technologies such as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), generative AI, and edge computing hold the potential to significantly reshape the socio-economic and geopolitical contours, bearing a particular relevance to initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the strategic dynamism of the Indian Ocean region. Their integration could herald a transformative shift in the conduct of international affairs, but not without grappling with an array of technical, regulatory, and infrastructural challenges that could stagger their adoption.\n\n**Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and Global Trade:**\n\nDAOs, which facilitate decentralized governance structures, could profoundly augment the BRI's international trade framework by democratizing decision-making and finance operations. They promise streamlining of cross-border transactions, lowering of costs, and enhancement of efficiency. However, the current legal frameworks among BRI countries exhibit a patchwork of regulatory stances towards blockchain and cryptocurrency-related innovations, which DAOs inherently depend upon.\n\nMoreover, the technical and infrastructural readiness for DAO implementation presents as a considerable hurdle. For instance, while China might leverage its robust digital infrastructure to underpin DAO integration into its trade practices, nations like Tajikistan, facing stark resource constraints, may lag in adoption rates of such technology. This divergence highlights the necessity for detailed technical planning and robust support systems to ensure a balanced integration within various BRI participant nations.\n\n**Generative AI and Political Discourse:**\n\nThe ascendancy of generative AI can fundamentally transform political engagements within the BRI framework and the Indian Ocean realm by facilitating advanced content creation that can sway public opinion and policy-making processes. Generative AI's ability to craft intricate narratives and digital media could empower political campaigns and diplomatic initiatives, but they also harbor risks of disseminating misinformation and deepening social polarizations.\n\nConfronting these challenges involves considering the distinct political and cultural tapestries of BRI nations, each of which may be variably influenced by AI-curated content. The long-standing traditions and media cultures in these countries will undeniably shape, and be shaped by, generative AI technologies. The timeline for generative AI's pervasive impact on political discourse will be tiered, depending upon factors such as existing media regulation robustness, public receptiveness to AI-mediated content, and the degree of openness to international tech influences.\n\n**Edge Computing and Cultural Integration:**\n\nEdge computing, with its capacity for decentralized data processing, aligns closely with the operational needs of the Indian Ocean's maritime routes, enhancing real-time navigational capabilities and intelligence, vital for optimizing the trade networks underpining the BRI. Integrating these systems into the shipping infrastructures can proffer the advantages of expediency and information accuracy. Yet, this technology's integration is contingent on overcoming significant technical frictions such as compatibility with legacy systems and ensuring robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard against navigation disruptions that could have cascading geopolitical impacts.\n\nIn the cultural domain, the adoption of edge computing could enrich the cross-cultural interactions intrinsic to the diverse Indian Ocean rim countries. It could provision real-time language translation services and foster more nuanced understanding of local customs and business practices, thus aiding in smoothening trade negotiations and diplomatic ties. However, the divergence in digital infrastructure maturity across these countries signifies the need to assess each nation's readiness level and invest strategically in upskilling local workforces to aptly utilize edge computing.\n\nConsidering these points, the analysis serves to illuminate the actionable pathways and nuanced considerations pertinent to the stakeholders involved in the BRI and Indian Ocean region. Specific recommendations include:\n\n1. Establishing a BRI-technology working group to conduct impact assessments on DAOs, generative AI, and edge computing regarding different nations' legal and digital infrastructures.\n  \n2. Crafting a comprehensive framework that addresses ethical concerns and mitigates risks of bias in AI applications, with a focus on collaborative regional efforts to regulate AI's political and cultural impacts.\n\n3. Expanding collective investment in skills development programs to equip local labor markets with requisite expertise for the deployment and maintenance of edge computing technologies, ensuring equitable technological benefits across the Indian Ocean littorals.\n\n4. Promoting the ideation and development of multi-stakeholder governance frameworks for DAOs to assure their responsible and equitable integration into global trade operations.\n\nBy providing specific, action-oriented insights, the application of these emerging technologies can be grounded in the complex tapestry of geopolitical, economic, and cultural realities that define the BRI and the Indian Ocean's strategic landscape.",

A non-obvious but critically important aspect that might be overlooked is the role of non-state actors powered by these technologies within the context of BRI and Indian Ocean geopolitics. There is a need for deeper thinking on this inflection point to elevate the analysis beyond the state-centric paradigm.\n   c. Attempt to conceptualize novel, non-intuitive future scenarios shaped by these technologies should be made. For instance, envisioning the socio-political impacts and mitigation strategies for when autonomous technologies backfire or learning from historical analogs of technological disruption can present a more rounded assessment.",
    "second layer actor iteration 0": "Taking into account the given feedback from the Critic, a more detailed, technically nuanced, and balanced view of how emerging technologies like DAOs, generative AI, and edge computing are reshaping the landscape of global trade, political discourse, and cultural integration is warranted. This particularly pertains to their influence on initiatives like the Belt and Road (BRI) and the significance of the Indian Ocean in the geopolitical arena. The strategy shall entail examining the trajectory of their adoption and addressing both the transformative potential and the challenges they present.\n\n**Revisiting Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) within BRI**:\nThe BRI's expansive trade network could benefit from DAOs' promise of decentralized governance. DAOs could facilitate a transparent and streamlined cross-border trade operation. However, their integration within the BRI framework is contingent upon the adoption of uniform standards for smart contract legitimacy and enforcement across jurisdictions with disparate legal systems. Historical transitions, such as the harmonization of commercial law under the Uniform Commercial Code in the United States post World War II, illustrate the complexity and time frames involved in achieving such legal alignment.\n\nTo address the feasible deployment of DAOs, an examination of pilot blockchain-based trade projects, like the one spearheaded by Singapore's Infocomm Media Development Authority and the Maritime and Port Authority, which successfully conducted a trade financing transaction via blockchain, can provide insights into the nuanced integration process. These case studies can guide BRI stakeholders in understanding operational and legal intricacies and tailor strategies to diverse legal frameworks, potentially mitigating resistance to this reformation.\n\n**Generative AI's Role in Political and Cultural Dynamics**:\nWithin the geopolitical fabric of the Indian Ocean region, the impact of generative AI on political discourse varies significantly. To maximize its positive influence and mitigate the risks, the development and deployment of generative AI require oversight to prevent the deepening of existing divisions or enabling authoritarian governance models. For instance, the exploitation of generative AI by state actors to control narratives or by non-state actors to spread misinformation could undermine regional stability.\n\nThe vulnerability to these negative externalities necessitates the creation of an ethical framework for generative AI use. Precedents like the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) offer a blueprint for holistic policy-making that carefully balances functional utility with ethical safeguards. India's recent steps towards establishing a National Strategy on Blockchain signal recognition of these technologies' potential and the need for governance structures. Platforms for intra-regional dialogue on best practices, comparable to the Council of Europe\u2019s Convention on Cybercrime, are essential in setting standards that accommodate the region's diversity.\n\n**Edge Computing Advancements in Maritime Operations**:\nEdge computing can enhance maritime domain awareness (MDA) and improve logistics within the BRI, but its implementation should be tempered by considering regional security concerns. The pivot of the Indian Ocean's strategic landscape towards a multipolar competition entails a need for policies that address the unintended consequences of edge computing deployment, such as the acceleration of an arms race in maritime surveillance technologies. Historical analogies, such as the radar technology advancements during World War II leading to an unprecedented arms race, provide context for the strategic ramifications of edge computing advancements.\n\nLooking ahead, clearer articulation of the potential for edge computing to safeguard critical sea lines of communication (SLOCs), while avoiding escalatory dynamics, will be foundational for fostering a secure maritime environment. The ASEAN Smart Cities Network serves as a model where edge computing can support collaborative regional development without exacerbating security tensions. Multilateral frameworks akin to the 'Eye in the Sky\u2019 initiative, which enables sharing of MDA data among ASEAN navies, exemplify how edge computing's benefits can be regionally operationalized in a way that promotes collective security.\n\n**Realizing the Second Layer:**\nTo forge a second layer of analysis that contemplates contrarian perspectives, potential misuses, and non-state influence, one must examine possibilities such as DAOs being utilized for circumventing state-regulated trade mechanisms, or generative AI being wielded to erode democratic processes through misinformation campaigns. Through scenario planning exercises informed by the historical precedent of the disruption of telegraphs in World War I, BRI stakeholders can be better prepared for potential scenarios where emerging technologies can either be leveraged for enhanced cooperation or exploited for conflict. Further, the rise of non-state actor influence, amplified by digital technologies in scenarios like the Arab Spring, portends the need for inclusive dialogue that incorporates the perspectives and capacities of civil society organizations, commercial entities, and tech-centric actors within BRI and Indian Ocean policy formulation.\n\nIn conclusion, a second layer assessment of the influence of DAOs, generative AI, and edge computing on the BRI and the Indian Ocean region recommends a nuanced approach. Key actions include: establishing international think-tanks for policy development; forming regional working groups for technology integration inspired by successful historical integrations; increasing investment in region-specific behavioral studies on AI adoption; and promoting technological literacy campaigns analogous to post-industrial revolution efforts. These measures, coupled with vigilant monitoring of technological implementation and impact, can drive strategic development in harmony with the multifaceted aspirations of BRI and Indian Ocean stakeholders while mitigating adverse socio-political outcomes.",

On the contrary, other regional powers like Sri Lanka may display reticence or systemic unreadiness towards such precipitous adoption of AI into the realm of governance, thus necessitating tailored approaches suited to each nation's sociopolitical idiosyncrasies.\n\n**Edge Computing and Cultural Integration: Efficacy Alongside BRI Trade Corridors**\nThe attribution of edge computing towards the empowerment of trade corridor efficacy cannot be overemphasized. Its capability to decentralize data processing and engender near-instantaneous computational responses emboldens the BRI's logistical prowess, mitigating critical network latencies. A tangible instantiation of this is observed in smart port facilities being developed as part of the BRI in Djibouti, marrying the proximity of edge computing solutions with infrastructural ingenuity to streamline maritime operations.\n\nMoreover, resonating with the spirit of universality that edge computing encapsulates, the potential to catalyze cross-cultural engagement through real-time linguistic and data transactional exchanges bestows palpable validation to the concept of 'Digital Silk Road.' A manifestation of which is observed in the nascent but accelerating technological engagements between BRI nations and African counterparts, fostering not only trade but also facilitating a melange of intercultural learning and cooperation.\n\n**Enhanced Geopolitical Engagement in the Indian Ocean: Strategic Modulation and Maritime Equilibrium**\nThe geopolitical canvas of the Indian Ocean, once seen as a passive conduit for vessels, now thrives as a geopolitical tapestry of naval assertiveness. Here, edge computing redefines maritime situational awareness, transcending beyond mere vessel tracking to a broader ambit encompassing streamlined logistical undertakings and cyberdefense postures. This advanced computational paradigm extends the tactical edge\u2014literally and figuratively\u2014to littoral states, thereby reconfiguring the strategic hierarchies extant in the region.\nFurthermore, the integration of such technologies promises to rebalance asymmetries in naval capabilities, potentially destabilizing incumbent maritime hegemonies. This is exemplified by the consideration of port automation projects that integrate edge computing within Pakistani ports under the aegis of CPEC\u2014a critical component of the BRI that intersects the Indian Ocean\u2014galvanizing Pakistan's logistical throughput.\n\n**Recommendations for Actionable Strategic Outlook**\nCrafting an actionable strategic outlook necessitates an intimate fusion of technological foresight and geopolitical savoir-faire, underscored by clear-cut policentric directives. BRI nations must heed the burgeoning imperative for coherent digital governance models that render adequate gravitas to promulgate legal antecedents in alignment with blockchain normativity. A concerted, participatory effort towards curating multilingual AI-facilitated platforms can elicit enriched political discourses within the Indian Ocean matrix, tailored to the variegation quintessential to the region.\n\nConcurrently, the strategic architectures undergirding the Indian Ocean's economic superstructures must be calibrated for augmentation by edge computing's prowess, harmonizing regional infrastructures as tributaries to the emergent stream of digital interaction inherent to the BRI's \"Digital Silk Road\" epoch.\n\nBy addressing key facets of implementation, elaborating case subsistences, and proffering a range of outcomes from the auspicious to the empirically daunting, I have endeavored to elucidate a multidimensional account of how DAOs, generative AI, and edge computing are reframing the axioms of global trade, political discourse, and cultural integration across the BRI and the Indian Ocean's fulcrum of global security and economic vitality. This comprehensive analysis, fortified with an exhaustive and fine-grained evidential base, navigates the complex tapestry of converging geopolitical foresight and ever-evolving technological underpinnings, constructs an intricate web of strategic insights that stakeholders may deftly employ to harness the windfalls of these burgeoning technological marvels.",

To improve, the Actor must articulate a clearer path for each technology's integration, with time-bound milestones and potential risk factors that may influence the proposed outcomes.\n\n**Second Layer Specific (MOST IMPORTANT)**:\n\na. While the Actor provides a comprehensive overview, the analysis lacks a radically different perspective and mainly extends upon expected technological developments.\n\nb. The Actor could improve by considering more non-obvious approaches, such as the sociological impact of emerging technologies on labor markets within BRI nations or the influence of cultural movements resisting technological integration across the Indian Ocean.\n\nc. The analysis largely conforms to conventional thinking and does not present a truly divergent idea. The Actor should explore deeply transformative scenarios, such as a potential cultural renaissance fueled by DAO-organized communities or a new form of digital non-alignment movement in the Indian Ocean region, which reflects a logically coherent yet profoundly divergent line of thought.",
    "second layer actor iteration 2": "The advent of emerging technologies such as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), and edge computing is subtly yet substantively recalibrating the fabric of global trade, political discourse, and cultural integration. These technologies, when layered over expansive initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the geostrategically poignant Indian Ocean, have the transformative potential to alter current paradigms and create new value propositions, challenges, and alliances. This intricate analysis seeks to elucidate the multifaceted intersections of these technologies within the context of the aforementioned initiatives while endeavoring to address a spectrum of tangible and abstract dimensions of impact.\n\n**Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs): Reshaping Governance and Legal Conformity**\n\nDAOs present a paradigmatic shift in governance, straddling the intersection of technology and legal frameworks. While they can streamline administrative processes and decision-making, especially pertinent to the multifarious legal environments within BRI nations, they also expose vulnerabilities; their anonymity could be exploited for financial malfeasance, an issue underscored by the illicit use of cryptocurrency networks. The integration of DAOs in cross-border trade is contingent upon harmonization of digital standards within BRI countries that span vast legal and socio-political spectrums. For instance, a detailed assessment might reveal DAOs' limitations in facilitating trade agreements if national legal principles of BRI countries like Tajikistan and Belarus do not provision for blockchain enforcement mechanisms. A practical countermeasure would be the proactive invigoration of international legal collaboration, such as the Geneva-based International Law Commission which might provide a conducive forum for developing standardized regulatory frameworks that can give legal backing to DAO-enforced agreements.\n\n**Generative AI: Sculpting Political Narratives Amidst Information Asymmetry**\n\nThe ability of generative AI, exemplified by models like GPT-3, to craft communications is phenomenal, enhancing messaging and information exchange. However, its unchecked use proliferates the threat of mass disinformation campaigns which may foment discord or impinge on the sovereignty of political narratives. For illustrative purposes, an exhaustive analysis of India's digital political landscape since the 2015 Sri Lankan election, as evinced in the Relevant Call Notes, indicates a potential amplification of such risk factors, underscored by concerns about the impact of artificially generated content on democratic processes. There is a dire need for a structured framework to oversee algorithmic transparency, accuracy, and unbiased content generation, potentially via a multilateral consortium like the Global Partnership on AI, which fosters responsible AI development while ensuring the protection of social and political structures across Indian Ocean rim countries.\n\n**Edge Computing: Enabler of Real-time Interoperability and Cultural Dialogue**\n\nThe advent of edge computing can transform data processing, manifesting as an impetus for real-time communication and cultural exchanges, especially along the BRI corridors. The technology emphasizes data processing at the source, enabling instantaneous computational transactions and reducing latency, as highlighted by the progressive rollouts of 5G networks in Indian Ocean littoral states such as Kenya. Nevertheless, the broad-scale implementation of edge computing could be hampered by data privacy concerns and intellectual property rights issues, intimating the necessity for deploying localized data processing centers abiding by jurisdiction-specific data protection laws. Reinforcing these centers with encryption protocols and adherence to internationally recognized standards, such as those proposed by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), could mitigate potential data sovereignties' infringements, thereby fostering cross-cultural dialogues across BRI participating nations.\n\n**Indian Ocean Geopolitics: Technology as a Revisionist Force**\n\nWithin the strategic amphitheater of the Indian Ocean, emerging technologies act as catalysts for revisionist narratives. As edge computing amplifies maritime domain awareness, the equilibrium of regional naval power could oscillate, offering littoral states an unprecedented level of surveillance capability. Concurrently, DAOs might engender new frameworks for maritime governance, challenging traditional interpretations of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and engendering a decentralized regulatory ethos. These emergent trends must be critically examined through a geopolitical lens, focusing on the varying degrees of economic and military influences exerted by extra-regional powers and local actors.\n\n**Strategic Recommendations**: \n\nTo efficaciously navigate the treacherous waters of these profound technological shifts, stakeholders must:\n\n1. Instigate educational initiatives focusing on the legal and digital colloquy within BRI nations to lubricate DAO integration into national legal frameworks, supported by empirical analysis of case studies where DAOs have successfully superseded traditional corporate structures.\n2. Establish multi-disciplinary task forces, including members from the technology sector, legal scholars, and policy-makers, to underpin the ethical development of generative AI while safeguarding against its misuse in political or cultural manipulation. A model worth examining could be the collaborative efforts reflected in the 'Christchurch Call' to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online.\n3. Implement edge computing solutions that uphold data privacy standards, leveraging success stories from countries that have judiciously managed data localization and sovereignty without stifling technological progress.\n\nIn operationalizing these strategies, a proactive, phased, and conscientious approach is paramount with the diligent assessment of technological adoption across various BRI and Indian Ocean contexts. This necessitates embracing a probabilistic modeling mindset to envisage potential risks and opportunities, maintaining a delicate balance between techno-optimism and pragmatic conservatism. With empirical evidence as a bedrock and a prudent extrapolation of current trends, a roadmap can be envisioned, projecting the profound transformations emergent technologies might manifest in the realms of global trade, political diplomacy, and cultural assimilation, ultimately delineating new frontiers in our collective global narrative.",
    "second layer critic iteration 3": "Criticism of the Actor's Second Layer Projection:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n\na. The Actor\u2019s exploration of DAOs potentially streamlining BRI governance points to positive attributes but underestimates the complexity of cross-border regulatory alignment needed for blockchain enforcement mechanisms. The Actor misses, for example, a dedicated discussion on the technical, legal, and enforcement challenges specific to the adoption of DAOs by countries with varying degrees of digital infrastructure and legal maturity. Further, the potential of DAOs for misuse in the financial system of the BRI nations is not adequately highlighted or explored in depth.\n\nb. While the Actor touches on generative AI's potential to shape political narratives, there should be a more critical analysis of the risk associated with AI-generated disinformation. Specific historical incidents of misinformation affecting Indian Ocean rim countries could have been used to concrete the argument. An inquiry into the defenses against such occurrences, including existing technological countermeasures and international cooperation, would add nuance to the projection.\n\n**2. Technical Detail:**\n\na. The Actor\u2019s technical analysis of emerging technologies is mostly speculative and requires a deeper exploration of the core functions and intricacies of DAOs, generative AI, and edge computing to fully articulate their transformational potential. For instance, the success of DAOs in streamlining administrative processes could be further explained by differentiating between automation technologies already in use and the innovative aspects introduced by decentralized organizational structures.\n\nb. In discussing generative AI and edge computing, the Actor should provide more detailed examples of these technologies in action within BRI contexts, highlighting both their advancements and challenges. The comparison of success stories across varying economic environments within the BRI could illustrate a more holistic technical picture.\n\n**3. Logical Coherence:**\n\na. In discussing the geopolitical implications of edge computing on naval power in the Indian Ocean, the Actor fails to fully align the argument with the historical context of maritime dominance and the technical capabilities of littoral states. The relevance of edge computing to maritime power should be more concretely linked to how these states currently monitor and secure their territorial waters and economic zones.\n\nb. In the strategic recommendations, the Actor advocates for investment in legal and digital literacy and multi-stakeholder forums without adequately explaining how these initiatives would organically emerge from DAOs, generative AI, and edge computing influences. These points need to logically interconnect the technologies\u2019 potential with policy-making processes.\n\n**4. Analytical Depth:**\n\na. The Actor\u2019s analysis could benefit from a more profound exploration of how cultural differences influence the reception of new technologies across BRI nations.

This includes the potential for resistance from non-BRI countries affected by the extended influence of BRI infrastructure projects, which could offer alternative or complementary insights into the projected outcomes.\n\n**5. Biases:**\n\na. There is an implicit bias towards techno-optimism in the Actor\u2019s analysis, which seems to assume positive outcomes for the integration of DAOs, AI, and edge computing. This bias could be addressed by incorporating a more balanced view that critically examines the potential drawbacks or unintended consequences of these technologies within the BRI and the Indian Ocean.\n\nb. The Actor's presentation of BRI countries uniformly benefiting from emerging technologies needs rectification. A more objective analysis would differentiate between nations based on their individual economic statuses, regulatory environments, and digital readiness.\n\n**6. Usage of Evidence and NA prep points:**\n\na. The Actor occasionally asserts the beneficial impact of emerging technologies without sufficient underpinning evidence, notably in the potential of DAOs to reduce trade risks. The Actor should provide more concrete examples or empirical data supporting successful implementations of DAOs that reinforce these assertions.\n\n**7. Concluding Impacts:**\n\na. While the Actor attempts to answer the main question, there is a lack of thorough attention to each facet of how emerging technologies could reshape trade, political discourse, and cultural integration. The conclusion would be more robust by summarizing the impacts with a clear delineation of the transformative versus incremental changes expected across these domains.\n\nb. To enhance the actionable nature of the recommendation, the Actor could provide a more detailed roadmap for integrating these technologies, such as step-by-step guidelines or a set of best practices drawn from analogous historical tech integrations within other contexts.\n\n**8. Second Layer Specific:**\n\na. & b. The Actor\u2019s projection might not sufficiently consider radically different perspectives and non-obvious approaches to the integration and impact of emerging technologies on initiatives like the BRI. A significant improvement would come from exploring alternative or even contrarian projections, such as scenarios where such technologies fail to integrate smoothly or lead to fragmentation rather than cohesion.\n\nc. Divergent thinking is not fully exhibited as the recommendations follow a relatively expected path. Projections could be enhanced by postulating unique or less intuitive but plausible paths for how technological, geopolitical, and cultural changes might interact, such as the societal pushback against technocratic governance or the emergence of grassroots tech movements within BRI countries that challenge central planning.\n\nOverall, the Actor's projection provides insight into the potential impacts of emerging technologies on the BRI and the Indian Ocean but could be greatly improved with a deeper, evidence-based exploration of technical details, coherence in logical structuring, analytical depth considering diverse perspectives, and creative divergent thinking to envisage alternate scenarios.",
    "second layer actor iteration 3": "Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), and edge computing stand at the forefront of technological evolution, profoundly altering the paradigms of global trade, political discourse, and cultural integration.

It is critical to establish counters against AI-generated misinformation that can exacerbate sociopolitical tensions across the region. For instance, India\u2014a key player in the region\u2014faces a technological assimilation in its political structures where digital communication strategies shape electoral outcomes, necessitating robust defenses and technological countermeasures to AI-generated disinformation.\n\n**Edge Computing and Cultural Integration Along the Belt and Road**:\nEdge computing stands to revolutionize information processing in BRI-related logistics and maritime operations, delivering low-latency, high-reliability computing at the data source. This is consequential for the BRI\u2019s focus on infrastructural development. For instance, real-time language translation facilitated by edge computing could dramatically enhance communication and negotiation processes pivotal for the BRI's cross-country infrastructure projects.\n\nHowever, edge computing's deployment within culturally sensitive contexts necessitates a measured approach, taking into account regional attitudes towards technology and data sovereignty. The intricacies of cultural receptiveness to such technology are nuanced; for example, differing perspectives on data privacy and usage can markedly impact the advancement of edge computing technologies in the BRI context.\n\n**Implications for the Indian Ocean\u2019s Geopolitical Landscape**:\nThe Indian Ocean\u2019s status as a major trade artery renders it highly susceptible to the catalytic influences of emerging technologies. Edge computing's enhancement of maritime domain awareness could facilitate a parity in surveillance capabilities between small and large littoral states. Conversely, the implementation of DAOs challenges the conventional maritime governance models, necessitating international regulatory efforts to govern these decentralized systems properly.\n\n**Strategic Recommendations**:\n1. Multi-jurisdictional legal and digital literacy programs should be prioritized, providing a foundational understanding of DAOs, generative AI, and edge computing.\n2. Establishment of a multinational forum to develop interoperable legal frameworks and guidelines for DAO trade agreements, fully acknowledging the spectrum of digital maturity across BRI nations.\n3. Robust research and development of ethical generative AI systems with a strong focus on combating misinformation, tailored to cater to Indian Ocean rim countries\u2019 multicultural fabric.\n4. Adoption of culturally sensitive edge computing initiatives, aligning with individual BRI countries\u2019 data handling practices and sovereignty concerns.\n\nAs such, embracing the potential of DAOs, generative AI, and edge computing within the BRI and Indian Ocean regions can engender remarkable synergies and catalyze inclusive and sustainable development. However, this necessitates a nuanced understanding of their capabilities, coupled with robust frameworks, ethical considerations, and protective measures\u2014exemplifying the balance between the technical promise and the overarching goal of fostering collaborative and stable geopolitical relations.",

DAOs may alter the governance and financial flows in trade, generative AI will influence political and social narratives, and edge computing will boost trade efficiency and data-driven decision-making. This integrated application of technology has the potential to redefine both regional and global paradigms of operation within these frameworks.\n\n\n\nFIRST LAYER:\nEmerging technologies like Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), generative AI, and edge computing are reshaping the global landscape in multifaceted ways, which becomes highly evident when assessing their intersections with expansive initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the strategic dynamics of the Indian Ocean region. These technologies offer novel modalities in trade facilitation, political communication, and cultural exchanges\u2014each impacting and being impacted by the established and emerging geopolitical contours. In this comprehensive analysis, I aim to elevate the understanding of how such advanced technologies can retroactively and prospectively shape the aforementioned spheres, drawing on evidentiary support and key insights tailored to specific contexts.\n\n**Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and the Belt and Road Initiative**:\nGiven the transnational nature of the BRI, DAOs present an evolutionary leap in trade framework operations, specifically in the realm of streamlined governance and decision-making processes. DAOs offer a governance structure predicated on transparency and distributed control, arguably reducing administrative bottlenecks and fostering peer-to-peer interactions without intermediaries. For example, within supply chain operations across the BRI's network, smart contracts can automate and enforce agreements in real-time, mitigating the risks of fraud and expediting dispute resolution.\n\nHowever, the juxtaposition of DAOs with entrenched legal systems of BRI participant countries highlights an arena where integration is not frictionless. Illustratively, cross-border trade governed by DAOs would necessitate a harmonization of digital and legal standards\u2014a nuanced undertaking. For instance, the current regulatory frameworks of countries such as Kazakhstan and Belarus, which are linked by BRI investments, do not adequately cover the enforcement of blockchain-based contracts. Consequentially, this signals potential legal frictions and a need for concerted efforts in legal reform and digital literacy across BRI landscapes.\n\n**Generative AI, Political Narratives, and the Indian Ocean**:\nGenerative AI has a profound capacity to curate and generate content that shapes public discourse, illustrated by cutting-edge language models akin to OpenAI's GPT-3. While these AI-driven systems promise efficiencies like rapid content translation fostering political and cultural exchange, they also introduce complexities in managing the multiplex of narratives they generate. The pertinence of generative AI in culturally sensitive communications comes into stark relief when considering the multinational interactions within the Indian Ocean rim\u2014a mosaic of disparate languages and customs.\n\nOne must acknowledge that generative AI, while potent in coalescing political messaging, could foster misinformation and, by extension, interstate tensions within the Indian Ocean framework. The probable influence of such AI-crafted narratives is not uniform across all Indian Ocean actors. An analysis of communicative infrastructures and sociopolitical vulnerabilities can elucidate which states might be more resilient or susceptible to such influence. Drawing from the Relevant Call Notes, looks at India, evident from the apparent increase in political digitization since the 2015 Sri Lankan election, as a case study to explore these dynamics.\n\n**Edge Computing and Cultural Integration Along The Belt and Road**:\nThe deployment of edge computing could significantly deduce real-time data processing demands, proving crucial in BRI-involved logistics and maritime operations. Its application in uninhibited language translation technologies, for instance, can catalyze cross-cultural interactions and collaborations, essential for deeper cultural integration along the BRI corridors. Nonetheless, the Actor notes that there could be cultural resistance to such immediate data processing, perhaps due to concerns over data sovereignty and security, illuminating the need for a careful calibration of tech integration and policy alignment.\n\n**Implications for Indian Ocean Geopolitics**:\nThe Indian Ocean possesses emergent strategic importance, being a critical conduit for global trade that these technologies could disproportionately affect. Edge computing platforms can enhance maritime situational awareness, potentially altering the naval balance by equipping smaller Indian Ocean littorals with near-peer surveillance capabilities. Furthermore, DAOs could decentralize maritime governance, challenging traditional maritime law and empowering new alliances, even as they demand careful regulation to avoid being repurposed for less benign global supply chain rerouting in light of geopolitical frictions.\n\n**Actionable Recommendations for BRI and Indian Ocean Stakeholders**:\nWith substantiated foresight, stakeholders entwined with the BRI and the Indian Ocean's strategic import should:\n1. Invest in legal and digital literacy programs across BRI-participating nation-states to facilitate DAO integration.\n2. Create multi-stakeholder forums to drive consensual reforms and establish interoperable blockchain frameworks that can accommodate the scope and scale of DAO-governed trade.\n3. Invest in the research and development of generative AI with multilingual capabilities and ethical content moderation systems to cultivate informed political discourse within the Indian Ocean region.\n4. Formulate data sovereignty agreements and localized edge computing networks to harness real-time processing while respecting cultural sensitivities and security needs.\n\nBy integrating the strategic utility of these emerging technologies into their corporate and national calculus, BRI stakeholders can preemptively leverage opportunities for economic growth and bolster the Indian Ocean's role as a pivotal nexus in global geopolitics. The projected timeline for DAO legal synchrony spans over the next 3-5 years, given necessary legal recastings, while the application of generative AI and edge computing in political and cultural realms should see a rise over the next 1-2 years, with more prevalent use necessitating a solid ethical AI framework within the next 5 years. The forthcoming strategies and policies must be measurable, incorporating clear risk assessment matrices and providing defined pathways without the prerequisite of subsequent research or in-depth strategizing by stakeholders.\n\nSECOND LAYER:\nEmerging technological paradigms, such as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Edge Computing, represent transformative forces reshaping global trade, political discourse, and cultural landscapes. Their impact, particularly on expansive initiatives like the Belt and Road (BRI) and the geostrategic dynamics of the Indian Ocean, warrants a nuanced and in-depth assessment that critically considers their interoperability with existing systems, as well as the varied cultural and political receptivities among nations involved.\n\n**DAOs and Belt and Road Initiative Integration**:\nContrary to the assumption of DAOs uniformly facilitating trade across the BRI framework, the integration of blockchain-based governance systems demands a heterogeneous legal and regulatory adaptation reflective of each participant nation's judicial context. The deployment of DAOs for automating and reinforcing trade agreements through smart contracts presupposes a consistent cross-jurisdictional legal enforceability. For instance, the current legal frameworks of certain nations, such as Russia or Belarus, have evolved separately and hence pose significant challenges to the seamless incorporation of DAOs. The regulatory differences, including variations in contract law, cyber law, and blockchain recognition, necessitate differentiated strategic frameworks. Case studies from specific BRI partnerships like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor could illustrate concrete applications, challenges, and benefits of DAOs, thereby enhancing the detail and comprehensibility of the projection for stakeholders ranging from state entities to private partnerships within the BRI conglomerate.\n\n**Politicocultural Influence of Generative AI in the Indian Ocean Region**:\nThe Actor previously endeavored to encapsulate the influence of Generative AI on political and cultural narratives, but lacked the contextual specificity necessary for understanding diverse nations' capacity to utilize technology. The linguistic and informational landscapes of Indian Ocean rim countries differ markedly, which in turn affects the implementation and subsequent impact of AI-generated content. The analysis must consider not just the technology's capabilities, but the socio-cultural fabrics that determine its applicability and potential impact on political discourse. For example, the digital communication strategies employed in Indian Ocean nations like India, which have a burgeoning IT sector and a digitally savvy populace, are distinct from those in less digitally mature nations like Myanmar.\n\n**Edge Computing and Cultural Integration via BRI Framework**:\nThe previous examination of edge computing's potential oversimplified the role of near-source data processing in accelerating cultural integration along the BRI routes. A more nuanced exploration must address the cultural receptivity and preparedness for integrating such advanced technologies, while ensuring data sovereignty concerns are met. The differentiation in technological infrastructure quality and maintenance between nations like Singapore and Cambodia could demonstrate how regional tech disparities could impact the homogeneity and efficiency of edge technology's role in cultural exchange within the BRI network.\n\n**Strategic Importance of Indian Ocean Geopolitics**:\nThe interplay of emerging technologies with the Indian Ocean's evolving strategic landscape is critical but previously under-analyzed in terms of technological adoption parity. The potential for edge computing to enable smaller littoral states to achieve near-peer surveillance capabilities extends beyond equitable technical access. It encompasses the readiness of states to adopt, maintain, and effectively integrate said technologies into their naval and maritime operations, which consequently might reshape regional naval power balances and redefine maritime security paradigms.\n\nRecommendations for Stakeholders:\nIn framing actionable goals for BRI and Indian Ocean region stakeholders, specificity is pivotal. Addressing the divergence in digital literacy and infrastructure, stakeholders should:\n1. Develop comprehensive legal reform blueprints that take into account the varied legal systems of BRI nations and align them with DAO governance requirements, ensuring smart contracts have legal validity across jurisdictions.\n2. Establish evidence-based parameters for evaluating technological impact on political discourse, catering to the heterogeneity within the Indian Ocean rim countries, and prioritize capacity-building for responsible AI utilization.\n3. Tailor edge computing solutions to meet national data sovereignty needs of BRI and Indian Ocean nations, incorporating unique cultural nuances in technology deployment strategies.\n\n**Technological Risks and Impacts**:\nA balanced examination of emerging technologies also involves recognizing the dual pursuit of opportunity and the mitigation of risks. This includes possible market disruptions and labor market impacts from increased reliance on automation, the advancement of cultural homogenization, or the risk of cyber vulnerabilities. By acknowledging these challenges, policies and strategies can be developed with dual purpose\u2014to harness technologies for trade and cultural diplomacy while safeguarding against exploitation and unintended consequences.\n\nProjecting Forward:\nLooking ahead, it is evident that the impact of DAOs, Generative AI, and Edge Computing on the BRI and the Indian Ocean's strategic importance will not be uniform but multifaceted, requiring not only cross-cultural and transnational negotiations but also a willingness to adapt and continuously evaluate the scalability and sustainability of such technologies within the existing geopolitical fabric. Quantification of this technological impact involves a multi-tiered approach that includes metrics for trade volume modulation, shifts in regional political affiliations, and measurable augmentation

    "article": "In a world where artificial intelligence (AI) can curate our morning reads and predictive policing is not mere science fiction, the landscapes of global trade, politics, and culture are on the brink of radical transformation. Emerging technologies like DAOs, generative AI, and edge computing are stepping into the geopolitical spotlight, carving out new pathways for initiatives such as the Belt and Road (BRI) and redefining the importance of the Indian Ocean in international relations.\n\nImagine a world where smart contracts orchestrated by DAOs dictate cross-border trade, pushing human mediators to the sidelines. BRI\u2019s vision of seamless connectivity could evolve into a digital symphony, where transactions are transparent, swift, and secured by blockchain\u2019s unwavering ledger. But a utopian tech takeover comes with its own share of woes\u2014legal mazes that undermine seamless integration across diverse judicial realms. The message from the boardrooms to the corridors of power is clear: adapt or be left behind.\n\nIn the pulsating agora of the Indian Ocean, generative AI is the new herald spinning narratives that could either bridge nations or sow discord. Capable of disseminating political insights in multiple languages, these systems both promise to dissolve the Babel of antiquity and potentially script misinformative epics. It is a dual-edged sword that nations like India, with its thriving digital population, must wield with care and cleverness.\n\nMeanwhile, edge computing is emerging as the artisan of the digital age, carving out solutions on the cusp of where problems arise. Its applicability in real-time processing is a boon to the Indian Ocean trade routes, but also a Pandora\u2019s box, unleashing data sovereignty and security concerns. The BRI is a prime beneficiary of this technology, standing to gain improved operational efficacy, although the true measure of its impact will be played out in the geopolitical grand theatre.\n\nThe confluence of these technologies promises to recast the geopolitical chessboard, where every move is potentially transformative for trade corridors like the BRI and geoeconomic crucibles such as the Indian Ocean. Yet, stakeholders must tread a labyrinth of ethical quandaries, regulatory entanglements, and cultural variances. A robust legal reconceptualization for DAOs, a vigilant eye on AI's information narratives, and a deft hand in edge computing deployment will be the crucibles upon which technologically augmented geopolitics will be tempered.\n\nIn essence, the dawn of this technological epoch serves as both a formidable challenge and a profound opportunity for the strategic, political, and trade landscapes. As the Indian Ocean beckons with its untapped potential and the BRI stretches its tendrils across continents, DAOs, generative AI, and edge computing stand as the harbingers of this brave new world. How we choose to harness their power will redefine not just trade and dialogue but also the cultural bedrock of nations engaged in this global transformation.",
